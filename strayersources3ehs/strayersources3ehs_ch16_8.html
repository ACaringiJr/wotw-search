<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p065"><p>Nowhere did the example of the French Revolution echo more loudly than in the French Caribbean colony of Saint Domingue, later renamed Haiti (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch16/STR_02272_16_M03.html" data-target="_pop">Map 16.3</span>). Widely regarded as the richest colony in the world, Saint Domingue boasted 8,000 plantations, which in the late eighteenth century produced some 40 percent of the world’s sugar and perhaps half of its coffee. A slave labor force of about 500,000 people made up the vast majority of the colony’s population. Whites numbered about 40,000, sharply divided between very wel<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>t<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>do plantation owners, merchants, and lawyers and those known as <em>petits blancs</em> (pe<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>TEE blahnk), or poor whites. A third social group consisted of some 30,000 <em>gens de couleur libres</em> (free people of color), many of them of mixe<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>race background. Saint Domingue was a colonial society very different from the New England colonies or even the southern colonies of British North America. Given its enormous inequalities and its rampant exploitation, this Caribbean colony was primed for explosion.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p068"><p>What was distinctive about the Haitian Revolution, both in world history generally and in the history of Atlantic revolutions?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p066"><p>In such a volatile setting, the ideas and example of the French Revolution lit several fuses and set in motion a spiral of violence that engulfed the colony for more than a decade. The principles of the revolution, however, meant different things to different people. To the <em>grands blancs</em>— the rich white landowners — it suggested greater autonomy for the colony and fewer economic restrictions on trade, but they resented the demands of the <em>petits blancs</em>, who sought equality of citizenship for all whites. Both white groups were adamantly opposed to the insistence of free people of color that the “rights of man” meant equal treatment for all free people regardless of race. To the slaves, the promise of the French Revolution was a personal freedom that challenged the entire slave labor system. In a massive revolt beginning in 1791, triggered by rumors that the French king had already declared an end to slavery, slaves burned 1,000 plantations and killed hundreds of whites as well as mixed-race people.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p069"><p>Soon warring factions of slaves, whites, and free people of color battled one another. Spanish and British forces, seeking to enlarge their own empires at the expense of the French, only added to the turmoil. Amid the confusion, brutality, and massacres of the 1790s, power gravitated toward the slaves, now led by the astute Toussaint Louverture, himself a former slave. He and his successor overcame internal resistance, outmaneuvered the foreign powers, and even defeated an attempt by Napoleon to reestablish French control.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p070"><p>When the dust settled in the early years of the nineteenth century, it was clear that something remarkable and unprecedented had taken place, a revolution unique in the Atlantic world and in world history. Socially, the last had become first. In the only completely successful slave revolt in world history, “the lowest order of the society — slaves — became equal, free, and independent citizens.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-003_12">12</span> Politically, they had thrown off French colonial rule, creating the second independent republic in the Americas and the first non-European state to emerge from Western colonialism. They renamed their country “Haiti,” a term meaning “mountainous” or “rugged” in the language of the original Taino people. It was a symbolic break with Europe and represented an effort to connect with the long-deceased native inhabitants of the land. Some, in fact, referred to themselves as “Incas.” At the formal declaration of Haiti’s independence on January 1, 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the new country’s first head of state, declared: “I have given the French cannibals blood for blood; I have avenged America.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-003_13">13</span> In defining all Haitian citizens as “black” and legally equal regardless of color or class, Haiti directly confronted elite preferences for lighter skin even as it disallowed citizenship for most whites. Economically, the country’s plantation system, oriented wholly toward the export of sugar and coffee, had been largely destroyed. As whites fled or were killed, both private and state lands were redistributed among former slaves and free blacks, and Haiti became a nation of small-scale farmers producing mostly for their own needs, with a much smaller export sector.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p071"><p>The destructiveness of the Haitian Revolution, its bitter internal divisions of race and class, and continuing external opposition contributed much to Haiti’s abiding poverty as well as to its authoritarian and unstable politics. So too did the enormous “independence debt” that the French forced on the fledgling republic in 1825, a financial burden that endured for well over a century. “Freedom” in Haiti came to mean primarily the end of slavery rather than the establishment of political rights for all. In the early nineteenth century, however, Haiti was a source of enormous hope and of great fear. Within weeks of the Haitian slave uprising in 1791, Jamaican slaves had composed songs in its honor, and it was not long before slave owners in the Caribbean and North America observed a new “insolence” in their slaves. Certainly, its example inspired other slave rebellions, gave a boost to the dawning abolitionist movement, and has been a source of pride for people of African descent ever since.</p></div>

<h3 data-type="title" data-for_type="box" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-ch16-bx1-001l">AP® EXAM TIP</h3>
<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p035l"><p>The AP<sup>®</sup> exam always features questions about how people see themselves and others, known as questions of identity.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p072"><p>To whites throughout the hemisphere, the cautionary saying “Remember Haiti” reflected a sense of horror at what had occurred there and a determination not to allow political change to reproduce that fearful outcome again. Particularly in Latin America, the events in Haiti injected a deep caution and social conservatism in the elites who led their countries to independence in the early nineteenth century. Ironically, though, the Haitian Revolution also led to a temporary expansion of slavery elsewhere. Cuban plantations and their slave workers considerably increased their production of sugar as that of Haiti declined. Moreover, Napoleon’s defeat in Haiti persuaded him to sell to the United States the French territories known as the Louisiana Purchase, from which a number of “slave states” were carved out. Nor did the example of Haiti lead to successful independence struggles in the rest of the thirty or so Caribbean colonies. Unlike mainland North and South America, Caribbean decolonization had to await the twentieth century. In such contradictory ways did the echoes of the Haitian Revolution reverberate in the Atlantic world.</p></div>
