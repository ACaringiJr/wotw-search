</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0163"><p>Historians and students of history seem endlessly fascinated by “firsts” — the first breakthrough to agriculture, the first domestication of horses, the first civilization, the first use of gunpowder, the first printing press, and so on. Each of these firsts presents a problem of explanation: why did it occur in some particular time and place rather than somewhere else or at some other time? Such questions have assumed historical significance because “first achievements” represent something new in the human journey and because many of them conveyed unusual power, wealth, status, or influence on their creators.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_773"><p>773</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0164"><p>Nonetheless, the focus on firsts can be misleading as well. Those who accomplished something first may see themselves as generally superior to those who embraced that innovation later. Historians too can sometimes adopt a winners-and-losers mentality, inviting a view of history as a horse race toward some finish line of accomplishment. Most first achievements in history, however, were not the result of intentional efforts but rather the unexpected outcome of converging circumstances.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0165"><p>The Industrial Revolution is a case in point. Understanding the European beginnings of this immense breakthrough is certainly justified by its pervasive global consequences and its global spread over the past several centuries. In terms of human ability to dominate the natural environment and to extract wealth from it, the Industrial Revolution marks a decisive turning point in the history of our species. But Europeans’ attempts to explain their Industrial Revolution have at times stated or implied their own unique genius. In the nineteenth century, many Europeans saw their technological mastery as a sure sign of their cultural and racial superiority as they came to use “machines as the measure of men.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec1-005_33">33</span> In pondering the “why Europe?” question, historians too have sometimes sought an answer in some distinct or even superior feature of European civilization.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0166"><p>In emphasizing the unexpectedness of the first Industrial Revolution, and the global context within which it occurred, world historians have attempted to avoid a “history as horse race” outlook. Clearly, the first industrial breakthrough in Britain was not a self-conscious effort to win a race; it was the surprising outcome of countless decisions by many people to further their own interests. Subsequently, however, other societies and their governments quite deliberately tried to catch up, seeking the wealth and power that the Industrial Revolution promised.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0167"><p>The rapid spread of industrialization across the planet, though highly uneven, may diminish the importance of the “why Europe?” issue. Just as no one views agriculture as a Middle Eastern phenomenon even though it occurred first in that region, it seems likely that industrialization will be seen increasingly as a global process rather than one uniquely associated with Europe. If industrial society proves to be a sustainable future for humankind — and this is presently an open question — historians of the future may well be more interested in the pattern of its global spread and in efforts to cope with its social and environmental consequences than in its origins in Western Europe.</p></div>
