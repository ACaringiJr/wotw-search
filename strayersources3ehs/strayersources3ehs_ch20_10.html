<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p068"><p>Far more important in the long run was the German expression of European fascism, which took shape as the Nazi Party under the leadership of Adolf Hitler (1889–1945). In many respects, German fascism was similar to its Italian counterpart. Both expressions of fascism espoused an extreme nationalism, openly advocated the use of violence as a political tool, generated a singl<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>party dictatorship, were led by charismatic figures, despised parliamentary democracy, hated communism, and viewed war as a positive and ennobling experience.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch20-sec2-004_5">5</span> The circumstances that gave rise to the Nazi movement were likewise broadly similar to those that generated Italian fascism, although the Nazis did not achieve national power until 1933.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p069"><p>The end of World War I witnessed the collapse of the German imperial government, itself less than a half century old. It was left to the democratic politicians of a new government — known as the Weimar Republic — to negotiate a peace settlement with the victorious allies. Traditional elites, who had withdrawn from public life in disgrace, never explicitly took responsibility for Germany’s defeat; instead they attacked the democratic politicians who had the unenviable task of signing the Treaty of Versailles and enforcing it. In this setting, some began to argue that German military forces had not really lost the war but that civilian socialists, communists, and Jews had betrayed the nation, “stabbing it in the back.”</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p072"><p>As in postwar Italy, liberal or democratic political leaders during the 1920s faced considerable hostility. Paramilitary groups of veterans known as the Freikorps assassinated hundreds of supporters of the Weimar regime. Gradually, some among the middle classes as well as conservative landowners joined in opposition to the Weimar government, as both groups were threatened by the ruinous inflation of 1923 and then the Great Depression. The German economy largely ground to a halt in the early 1930s amid massive unemployment among workers and the middle class alike. Everyone demanded decisive action from the state. Many industrial workers looked to socialists and communists for solutions; others turned to fascism. Large numbers of middl<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>class people deserted moderate political parties in favor of conservative and radical righ<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>wing movements.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_899"><p>899</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p073"><p>This was the context in which Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist, or Nazi, Party gained growing public support. Founded shortly after the end of World War I, that party under Hitler’s leadership proclaimed a message of intense German nationalism cast in terms of racial superiority, bitter hatred for Jews as an alien presence, passionate opposition to communism, a determination to rescue Germany from the humiliating requirements of the Treaty of Versailles, and a willingness to decisively tackle the country’s economic problems. Throughout the 1920s, the Nazis were a minor presence in German politics, gaining only 2.6 percent of the vote in the national elections of 1928. Just four years later, however, in the wake of the Depression’s terrible impact and the Weimar government’s inability to respond effectively, the Nazis attracted 37 percent of the vote. In 1933, Hitler was legally installed as the chancellor of the German government. Thus did the Weimar Republic, a democratic regime that never gained broad support, give way to the Third Reich.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p074"><p>Once in power, Hitler moved quickly to consolidate Nazi control of Germany. All other political parties were outlawed; independent labor unions were ended; thousands of opponents were arrested; and the press and radio came under state control. Far more thoroughly than Mussolini in Italy, Hitler and the Nazis established their control over German society.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p075"><p>By the late 1930s, Hitler apparently had the support of a considerable majority of the population, in large measure because his policies successfully brought Germany out of the Depression. The government invested heavily in projects such as superhighways, bridges, canals, and public buildings and, after 1935, in rebuilding and rearming the country’s diminished military forces. These policies drove down the number of unemployed Germans from 6.2 million in 1932 to fewer than 500,000 in 1937. Two years later, Germany had a labor shortage. Erna Kranz, a teenager in the 1930s, later remembered the early years of Nazi rule: “[There was] a glimmer of hope … not just for the unemployed but for everybody because we all knew that we were downtrodden…. It was a good time … there was order and discipline.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch20-sec2-004_6">6</span> Millions agreed with her.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p076"><p>Other factors as well contributed to Nazi popularity. Like Italian fascists, Hitler too appealed to rural and traditional values that many Germans feared losing as their country modernized. In Hitler’s thinking and in Nazi propaganda, Jews became the symbol of the urban, capitalist, and foreign influences that were undermining traditional German culture. Thus the Nazis reflected and reinforced a broader and long-established current of anti-Semitism that had deep roots in much of Europe. In his book <em>Mein Kampf</em> (<em>My Struggle</em>), Hitler outlined his case against the Jews and his call for the racial purification of Germany in vitriolic terms. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource201" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 20.1</span> for a statement of Hitler’s thinking.)</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p077"><p>Far more than elsewhere, this insistence on a racial revolution was a central feature of the Nazi program and differed from the racial attitudes in Italy, where Jews were a tiny minority of the population and deeply assimilated into Italian culture. Early on, Mussolini had ridiculed Nazi racism, but as Germany and Italy drew closer together, Italy too began a program of overt ant<span data-block_type="nobr">i-</span><wbr/>Semitism, though nothing approaching the extremes that characterized Nazi Germany.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_900"><p>900</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p078"><p>Upon coming to power, Hitler implemented policies that increasingly restricted Jewish life. Soon Jews were excluded from universities, professional organizations, and civil employment. In 1935, the Nuremberg Laws ended German citizenship for Jews and forbade marriage or sexual relations between Jews and Germans. On the night of November 9, 1938, known as Kristallnacht, persecution gave way to terror when Nazis smashed and looted Jewish shops. Such actions made clear the Nazis’ determination to rid Germany of its Jewish population, thus putting into effect the most radical element of Hitler’s program. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch20_12.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Etty Hillesum</span>.) Still, it was not yet apparent that this “racial revolution” would mean the mass killing of Europe’s Jews. That horrendous development emerged only in the context of World War II.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p079"><p>Beyond race, gender too figured prominently in Nazi thought and policies. Deeply antifeminist and resentful of the liberating changes that modern life had brought to European women, Nazis wanted to limit women largely to the home, removing them from the paid workforce. To Hitler, the state was the natural domain of men, while the home was the realm of women. “Woman in the workplace is an oppressed and tormented being,” declared a Nazi publication.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch20-sec2-004_7">7</span> Concerned about declining birthrates, Italy and Germany alike promoted a cult of motherhood, glorifying and rewarding women who produced children for the state. Accordingly, fascist regimes in both countries generally opposed abortion, contraception, family planning, and sex education, all of which were associated with feminist thinking.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p080"><p>Yet such an outlook did not necessarily coincide with conservative or puritanical sexual attitudes. In Germany, a stat<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>sponsored system of brothels was initiated in the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>1930s, for it was assumed that virile men would be promiscuous and that soldiers required a sexual outlet, if they were to contribute to the nation’s military strength. Because of this “need,” Nazi policy exempted condoms from the ban on birth control. Heinrich Himmler, a leading Nazi official, also openly encouraged illegitimate births among Aryans to augment the nation’s numbers. Thus Nazi rhetoric about the chaste Aryan family was trumped — or supplemented — by a desire to use sexuality to advance the cause of the nation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_901"><p>901</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p081"><p>Also sustaining Nazi rule were massive torchlight ceremonies celebrating the superiority of the German race and its folk culture. In these settings, Hitler was the mystical leader, the Führer, a mesmerizing orator who would lead Germany to national greatness and individual Germans to personal fulfillment.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p082"><p>If World War I and the Great Depression brought about the political and economic collapse of Europe, the Nazi phenomenon represented a moral collapse within the West, deriving from a highly selective incorporation of earlier strands of European culture. On the one hand, the Nazis actively rejected some of the values — rationalism, tolerance, democracy, human equality — that for many people had defined the core of Western civilization since the Enlightenment. On the other hand, they claimed the legacy of modern science, particularly in their concern to classify and rank various human groups. Thus they drew heavily on the “scientific racism” of the late nineteenth century and its expression in phrenology, which linked the size and shape of the skull to human behavior and personality (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch18_4.html" data-target="_pop">“Industry and Empire”</span> in Chapter 18). Moreover, in their effort to purify German society, the Nazis reflected the Enlightenment confidence in the perfectibility of humankind and in the social engineering necessary to achieve it.</p></div>
