<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-pt04-sec2-001">An Early Modern Era?
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p08"><p>Those three centuries, which are addressed in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch13_2.html">Chapters 13</span>, <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch14_2.html">14</span>, and <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch15_2.html">15</span>, are conventionally labeled as “the early modern era.” In using this term, historians are suggesting that during these three centuries we can find some initial signs or markers of the modern world, such as those described at the end of <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch12_2.html">Chapter 12</span>: the beginnings of genuine globalization, elements of distinctly modern societies, and a growing European presence in world affairs.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p09"><p>The most obvious expression of globalization, of course, lay in the oceanic journeys of European explorers and the European conquest and colonial settlement of the Americas. The Atlantic slave trade linked Africa permanently to the Western Hemisphere, while the global silver trade allowed Europeans to use New World precious metals to buy their way into ancient Asian trade routes. The massive transfer of plants, animals, diseases, and people, known to historians as the Columbian exchange, created wholly new networks of interaction across both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, with enormous global implications. Missionaries carried Christianity far beyond Europe, allowing it to become a genuinely world religion, with a presence in the Americas, China, Japan, the Philippines, and sout<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>central Africa. Other threads in the emerging global web were also woven as Russians marched across Siberia to the Pacific, as China expanded deep into Inner Asia, and as the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of the Middle East, North Africa, and southeastern Europe (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch13_2.html">Chapter 13</span>).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p010"><p>Scattered signs of what later generations thought of as “modernity” appeared in various places around the world. The most obviously modern cultural development took place in Europe, where the Scientific Revolution transformed, at least for a few people, their view of the world, their approach to knowledge, and their understanding of traditional Christianity. Demographically, China, Japan, India, and Europe experienced the beginnings of modern population growth as Eurasia recovered from the Black Death and Mongol wars and as the foods of the Americas — corn and potatoes, for example — provided nutrition to support larger numbers. World population more than doubled between 1400 and 1800 (from about 374 million to 968 million), even as the globalization of disease produced a demographic catastrophe in the Americas and the slave trade limited African population growth. More highly commercialized economies centered in large cities developed in various parts of Eurasia and the Americas. By the early eighteenth century, for example, Japan was one of the most urbanized societies in the world, with Edo (Tokyo) housing more than a million inhabitants and ranking as the world’s largest city. In China, Southeast Asia, India, and across the Atlantic basin, more and more people found themselves, sometimes willingly and at other times involuntarily, producing for distant markets rather than for the use of their local communities.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p011"><p>Stronger and more cohesive states represented yet another global pattern as they incorporated various local societies into larger units while actively promoting trade, manufacturing, and a common culture within their borders. France, the Dutch Republic, Russia, Morocco, the Mughal Empire, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, and Japan all represent this kind of state.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-pt04-sec2-001_1">1</span> Their military power likewise soared as the “gunpowder revolution” kicked in around the world. Thus large-scale empires proliferated across Asia and the Middle East, while various European powers carved out new domains in the Americas. Within these empires, human pressures on the land intensified as forests were felled, marshes drained, and the hunting grounds of foragers and the grazing lands of pastoralists were confiscated for farming or ranching.</p></div>
