</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p016"><p>At least five answers to this dilemma are reflected in the chapters that follow. The first is simply to remind ourselves how recent and perhaps how brief the European moment in world history has been. Other peoples too had times of “cultural flowering” that granted them a period of primacy or influence — for example, the Greeks (500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>–200 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), Indians of South Asia (200–600 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), Arabs (600–1000), Chinese (1000–1500), Mongols (1200–1350), and Incas and Aztecs (fifteenth century) — but all of these were limited to particular regions of Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasia or the Americas.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-pt05-sec2-002_2">2</span> Even though the European moment operated on a genuinely global scale, Western peoples have enjoyed their worldwide primacy for at most two centuries. Some scholars have suggested that the events of the late twentieth and early twent<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>first centuries — the end of colonial empires, the rise of India and especially China, and the assertion of Islam — mark the end, or at least the erosion, of the age of European predominance.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p017"><p>Second, we need to remember that the rise of Europe occurred within an international context. It was the withdrawal of the Chinese naval fleet that allowed Europeans to enter the Indian Ocean in the sixteenth century, while Native Americans’ lack of immunity to European diseases and their own divisions and conflicts greatly assisted the European takeover of the Western Hemisphere. The Industrial Revolution, explored in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch17_2.html">Chapter 17</span>, likewise benefited from New World resources and markets and from the stimulus of superior Asian textile and pottery production. <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch18_2.html">Chapters 18</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch19_2.html">19</span> make clear that European control of other regions everywhere depended on the cooperation of local elites. Such observations remind us that the remarkable — indeed revolutionary — transformations of the European moment in world history did not derive wholly from some special European genius or lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>term advantage. Rather, they emerged from a unique intersection of European historical development with that of other peoples, regions, and cultures. Europeans, like everyone else, were embedded in a web of relationships that shaped their own histories.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_692"><p>692</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p018"><p>A third reminder is that the rise of Europe to a position of global dominance was not an easy or automatic process. Frequently it occurred in the face of ferocious resistance and rebellion, which often required Europeans to modify their policies and practices. The so-called Indian mutiny in mid-nineteenth-century South Asia, a massive uprising against British colonial rule, did not end British control, but it substantially transformed the character of the colonial experience. In Africa, fear of offending Muslim sensibilities persuaded the British to keep European missionaries and mission schools out of northern Nigeria during the colonial era. Even when Europeans exercised political power, they could not do so precisely as they pleased. Empire, formal and informal alike, was always in some ways a negotiated arrangement.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p019"><p>Fourth, peoples the world over made active use of Europeans and European ideas for their own purposes, seeking to gain advantage over local rivals or to benefit themselves in light of new conditions. In Southeast Asia, for example, a number of highland minority groups, long oppressed by the dominant lowland Vietnamese, viewed the French invaders as liberators and assisted in their takeover of Vietnam. Hindus in India used the railroads, introduced by the British, to go on pilgrimages to holy sites more easily, while the printing press made possible the more widespread distribution of their sacred texts. During the Haitian Revolution, examined in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch16_2.html">Chapter 16</span>, enslaved Africans made use of radical French ideas about “the rights of man” in ways that most Europeans never intended. The leaders of a massive Chinese peasant upheaval in the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>nineteenth century adopted a unique form of Christianity to legitimate their revolutionary assault on an ancient social order. Recognizing that Asian and African peoples remained active agents, pursuing their own interests even in oppressive conditions, is another way of countering residual Eurocentrism.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p020"><p>Moreover, what was borrowed from Europe was always adapted to local circumstances. Thus Japanese or Russian industrial development did not wholly follow the pattern of England’s Industrial Revolution. The Christianity that took root in the Americas or later in Africa evolved in culturally distinctive ways. Ideas of nationalism, born in Europe, were used to oppose European imperialism throughout Asia and Africa. Russian and Chinese socialism in the twentieth century departed in many ways from the vision of Karl Marx. The most interesting stories of modern world history are not simply those of European triumph or the imposition of Western ideas and practices but those of encounters, though highly unequal, among culturally different peoples. It was from these encounters, not just from the intentions and actions of Europeans, that the dramatic global changes of the modern era arose.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p021"><p>A fifth and final antidote to Eurocentrism in an age of European centrality lies in the recognition that although Europeans gained an unprecedented prominence on the world stage, they were not the only game in town, nor were they the sole preoccupation of Asian, African, and Middle Eastern peoples. While China confronted Western aggression in the nineteenth century, it was also absorbing a huge population increase and experiencing massive peasant rebellions that grew out of distinctly Chinese conditions. The long relationship of Muslim and Hindu cultures in India continued to evolve under British colonial rule, as it had for centuries under other political systems. West African societies in the nineteenth century experienced a wave of religious wars that created new states and extended and transformed the practice of Islam, and that faith continued its centurie<span data-block_type="nobr">s-</span><wbr/>long spread on the continent even under European colonial rule. A further wave of wars and state formation in southern Africa transformed the political and ethnic landscape, even as European penetration picked up speed.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p022"><p>None of this diminishes the significance of the European moment in world history, but it sets that moment in a larger context of continuing patterns of historical development and of interaction and exchange with other peoples.</p></div>
