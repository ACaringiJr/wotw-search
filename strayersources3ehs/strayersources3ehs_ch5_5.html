<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p035a"><p>The roles of Confucian scholars, which lasted into the twentieth century, represent a major continuity in Chinese history.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p029"><p>Over time, this system of selecting administrators evolved into the world’s first professional civil service. In 124 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, Emperor Wu Di established an imperial academy where potential officials were trained as scholars and immersed in texts dealing with history, literature, art, and mathematics, with an emphasis on Confucian teachings. By the end of the Han dynasty, it enrolled some 30,000 students, who were by then subjected to a series of written examinations to select officials of various grades. Private schools in the provinces funneled still more aspiring candidates into this examination system, which persisted until the early twentieth century. In theory open to all men, this system in practice favored those whose families were wealthy enough to provide the years of education required to pass even the lower-level exams. Proximity to the capital and family connections to the imperial court also helped in gaining a position in this highest of Chinese elites. Nonetheless, village communities or a local landowner might sponsor the education of a bright young man from a commoner family, enabling him to enter the charmed circle of officialdom. One rags-to-riches story told of a pig farmer who became an adviser to the emperor himself. Thus the examination system provided a modest measure of social mobility in an otherwise quite hierarchical society.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p032"><p>In later dynasties, that system grew even more elaborate and became an enduring and distinguishing feature of Chinese civilization. During the Tang dynasty, the famous poet and official Po Chu-I (772–846 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>) wrote a poem titled “After Passing the Examination,” which shows something of the fame and fortune that awaited an accomplished student as well as the continuing loyalty to family and home that ideally marked those who succeeded:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-first" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p033"><p>For ten years I never left my books,</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p034"><p>I went up … and won unmerited praise.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p035"><p>My high place I do not much prize;</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p036"><p>The joy of my parents will first make me proud.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p037"><p>Fellow students, six or seven men,</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p038"><p>See me off as I leave the City gate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p039"><p>My covered coach is ready to drive away;</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p040"><p>Flutes and strings blend their parting tune.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p041"><p>Hopes achieved dull the pains of parting;</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p042"><p>Fumes of wine shorten the long road….</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p043"><p>Shod with wings is the horse of him who rides</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p045"><p>Those who made it into the bureaucracy entered a realm of high privilege and great prestige. Senior officials moved about in carriages and were bedecked with robes, ribbons, seals, and headdresses appropriate to their rank. Even lower officials who served in the provinces rather than the capital were distinguished by their polished speech, their cultural sophistication, and their urban manners as well as their political authority. Proud of their learning, they were the bearers, and often the makers, of Chinese culture. “Officials are the leaders of the populace,” stated an imperial edict of 144 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, “and it is right and proper that the carriages they ride in and the robes that they wear should correspond to the degrees of their dignity.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch05-sec2-001_3">3</span> Some of these men, particularly in times of political turmoil, experienced tension between their official duties and their personal inclination toward a more withdrawn life of reflective scholarship.
