</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p034"><p>The Industrial Revolution has long been a source of great controversy among scholars. Why did it occur first in Europe? Within Europe, why did it occur earliest in Great Britain? And why did it take place in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? Some explanations have sought the answer in unique and deeply rooted features of European society, history, or culture. One recent account, for example, argued that Europeans have been distinguished for several thousand years by a restless, creative, and freedo<span data-block_type="nobr">m-</span><wbr/>loving culture with its roots in the aristocratic warlike societies of early Ind<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>European invaders.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_4">4</span> While not denying certain distinctive qualities of the West, many world historians have challenged views that seem to suggest that Europe alone was destined to lead the way to modern economic life. Such an approach, they argue, not only is Eurocentric and deterministic but also flies in the face of much recent research.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p037"><p>In what respects did the roots of the Industrial Revolution lie within Europe? In what ways did that transformation have global roots?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p035"><p>Historians now know that other areas of the world had experienced times of great technological and scientific flourishing. Between 750 and 1100 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, the Islamic world generated major advances in shipbuilding, the use of tides and falling water to generate power, papermaking, textile production, chemical technologies, water mills, clocks, and much more.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_5">5</span> India had long been the world center of cotton textile production, the first place to turn sugarcane juice into crystallized sugar, and the source of many agricultural innovations and mathematical inventions. To the Arabs of the ninth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, India was a “place of marvels.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_6">6</span> More than either of these, China was clearly the world leader in technological innovation between 700 and 1400 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, prompting various scholars to suggest that China was on the edge of an industrial revolution by 1200 or so. For reasons much debated among historians, all of these flowerings of technological creativity had slowed down considerably or stagnated by the early modern era, when the pace of technological change in Europe began to pick up. But these earlier achievements certainly suggest that Europe was not alone in its capacity for technological innovation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p038"><p>Nor did Europe enjoy any overall economic advantage as late as 1750. Over the past several decades, historians have carefully examined the economic conditions of various Eurasian societies in the eighteenth century and found “a world of surprising resemblances.” Economic indicators such as life expectancies, patterns of consumption and nutrition, wage levels, general living standards, widespread free markets, and prosperous merchant communities suggest broadly similar conditions across the major civilizations of Europe and Asia.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_7">7</span> Thus Europe had no obvious economic lead, even on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. Rather, according to one leading scholar, “there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_8">8</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p039"><p>A final reason for doubting a unique European capacity for industrial development lies in the relatively rapid spread of industrial techniques to many parts of the world over the past 250 years, a fairly short time by world history standards. Although the process has been highly uneven, industrialization has taken root, to one degree or another, in Japan, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, South Korea, and elsewhere. Such a pattern weakens any suggestion that European culture or society was exceptionally compatible with industrial development.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p040"><p>Thus, while sharp debate continues, many contemporary historians are inclined to see the Industrial Revolution erupting rather quickly and quite unexpectedly between 1750 and 1850 (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch17/STR_02272_17_M01.html" data-target="_pop">Map 17.1</span>). Two intersecting factors help explain why this process occurred in Europe rather than elsewhere. One lies in certain patterns of Europe’s internal development that favored innovation. Its many small and highly competitive states, taking shape in the twelfth or thirteenth centuries, arguably provided an “insurance against economic and technological stagnation,” which the larger Chinese, Ottoman, or Mughal empires perhaps lacked.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_9">9</span> If so, then Western Europe’s failure to r<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>create the earlier unity of the Roman Empire may have acted as a stimulus to innovation.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p041"><p>Furthermore, the relative newness of these European states and their monarchs’ desperate need for revenue in the absence of an effective ta<span data-block_type="nobr">x-</span><wbr/>collecting bureaucracy pushed European royals into an unusual alliance with their merchant classes. Small groups of merchant capitalists might be granted special privileges, monopolies, or even ta<span data-block_type="nobr">x-</span><wbr/>collecting responsibilities in exchange for muc<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>needed loans or payments to the state. It was therefore in the interest of governments to actively encourage commerce and innovation. Thus states granted charters and monopolies to private trading companies, and governments founded scientific societies and offered prizes to promote innovation. In this way, European merchants and other innovators from the fifteenth century onward gained an unusual degree of freedom from state control and in some places a higher social status than their counterparts in more established civilizations. In Venice and Holland, merchants actually controlled the state. By the eighteenth century, major Western European societies were highly commercialized and governed by states generally supportive of private commerce. In short, they were well on their way toward capitalist economies — where buying and selling on the market was a widely established practice — before they experienced industrialization. Such internally competitive economies, coupled with a highly competitive system of rival states, arguably fostered innovation in the new civilization taking shape in Western Europe.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p042"><p>Europe’s societies, of course, were not alone in developing marke<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>based economies by the eighteenth century. Japan, India, and especially China were likewise highly commercialized or market driven. However, in the several centuries after 1500, Western Europe was unique in a second way. That region alone “found itself at the hub of the largest and most varied network of exchange in history.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_10">10</span> Widespread contact with culturally different peoples was yet another factor that historically has generated extensive change and innovation. This new global network, largely the creation of Europeans themselves, greatly energized commerce and brought Europeans into direct contact with peoples around the world.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_743"><p>743</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p043"><p>For example, Asia, home to the world’s richest and most sophisticated societies, was the initial destination of European voyages of exploration. The German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) encouraged Jesuit missionaries in China “not to worry so much about getting things European to the Chinese but rather about getting remarkable Chinese inventions to us.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_11">11</span> Inexpensive and well-made Indian textiles began to flood into Europe, causing one English observer to note: “Almost everything that used to be made of wool or silk, relating either to dress of the women or the furniture of our houses, was supplied by the Indian trade.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_12">12</span> The competitive stimulus of these Indian cotton textiles was certainly one factor driving innovation in the British textile industry. Likewise, the popularity of Chinese porcelain and Japanese lacquerware prompted imitation and innovation in England, France, and Holland.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_13">13</span> Thus competition from desirable, high-quality, and newly available Asian goods played a role in stimulating Europe’s Industrial Revolution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_744"><p>744</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p044"><p>In the Americas, Europeans found a windfall of silver that allowed them to operate in Asian markets. They also found timber, fish, maize, potatoes, and much else to sustain a growing population. Later, slave-produced cotton supplied an emerging textile industry with its key raw material at low prices, while sugar, similarly produced with slave labor, furnished cheap calories to European workers. “Europe’s Industrial Revolution,” concluded historian Peter Stearns, “stemmed in great part from Europe’s ability to draw disproportionately on world resources.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-001_14">14</span> The new societies of the Americas further offered a growing market for European machine-produced goods and generated substantial profits for European merchants and entrepreneurs. None of the other empires of the early modern era enriched their imperial heartlands so greatly or provided such a spur to technological and economic growth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p045"><p>Thus the intersection of new, highly commercialized, competitive European societies with the novel global network of their own making provides a context for understanding Europe’s Industrial Revolution. Commerce and cross-cultural exchange, acting in tandem, sustained the impressive technological changes of the first industrial societies.</p></div>
