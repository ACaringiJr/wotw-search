<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0121"><p>A third echo of the Atlantic revolutions lay in the emergence of a feminist movement. Although scattered voices had earlier challenged patriarchy, never before had an organized and substantial group of women called into question this most fundamental and accepted feature of all preindustrial civilizations — the subordination of women to men. But in the century following the French Revolution, such a challenge took shape, especially in Europe and North America. Then, in the twentieth century, feminist thinking transformed “the way in which women and men work, play, think, dress, worship, vote, reproduce, make love and make war.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-007_24">24</span> How did this extraordinary process get launched in the nineteenth century?</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0122"><p>Thinkers of the European Enlightenment had challenged many ancient traditions, including on occasion that of women’s intrinsic inferiority (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch15_18.html" data-target="_pop">“Science and Enlightenment”</span> in Chapter 15). The French writer Condorcet, for example, called for “the complete destruction of those prejudices that have established an inequality of rights between the sexes.” The French Revolution then raised the possibility of r<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>creating human societies on new foundations. Many women participated in these events, and a few insisted, unsuccessfully, that the revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality must include women. In neighboring England, the French Revolution stimulated the writer Mary Wollstonecraft to pen her famous <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, one of the earliest expressions of a feminist consciousness. “Who made man the exclusive judge,” she asked, “if woman partake with him of the gift of reason?”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0125"><p>Within the growing middle classes of industrializing societies, more women found both educational opportunities and some freedom from household drudgery. Such women increasingly took part in temperance movements, charities, abolitionism, and missionary work, as well as socialist and pacifist organizations. Some of their workin<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>class sisters became active trade unionists. On both sides of the Atlantic, small numbers of these women began to develop a feminist consciousness that viewed women as individuals with rights equal to those of men. The first organized expression of this new feminism took place at the Women’s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. At that meeting, Elizabeth Cady Stanton drafted a statement that began by paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>evident, that all men and women are created equal.”</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p035x"><p>Take notes on examples of nineteenth-century feminism as a transatlantic movement. It is important to note that nineteenth-century feminism was largely an upper- and middle-class movement.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0126"><p>From the beginning, feminism became a transatlantic movement in which European and American women attended the same conferences, corresponded regularly, and read one another’s work. Access to schools, universities, and the professions were among their major concerns as growing numbers of women sought these previously unavailable opportunities. The more radical among them refused to take their husbands’ surname or wore trousers under their skirts. Elizabeth Cady Stanton published a Women’s Bible, excising the parts she found offensive. As heirs to the French Revolution, feminists ardently believed in progress and insisted that it must now include a radical transformation of the position of women.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0127"><p>By the 1870s, feminist movements in the West were focusing primarily on the issue of suffrage and were gaining a growing constituency. Now many ordinary middle-class housewives and working-class mothers joined their better-educated sisters in the movement. By 1914, some 100,000 women took part in French feminist organizations, while the National American Woman Suffrage Association claimed 2 million members. Most operated through peaceful protest and persuasion, but the British Women’s Social and Political Union organized a campaign of violence that included blowing up railroad stations, slashing works of art, and smashing department store windows. One British activist, Emily Davison, threw herself in front of the king’s horse during a race in Britain in 1913 and was trampled to death. By the beginning of the twentieth century in the most highly industrialized countries of the West, the women’s movement had become a mass movement.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0128"><p>That movement had some effect. By 1900, upper- and middle-class women had gained entrance to universities, though in small numbers, and women’s literacy rates were growing steadily. In the United States, a number of states passed legislation allowing women to manage and control their own property and wages, separate from their husbands. Divorce laws were liberalized in some places. Professions such as medicine opened to a few, and teaching beckoned to many more. In Britain, Florence Nightingale professionalized nursing and attracted thousands of women into it, while Jane Addams in the United States virtually invented “social work,” which also became a female-dominated profession. Progress was slower in the political domain. In 1893, New Zealand became the first country to give the vote to all adult women; Finland followed in 1906. Elsewhere widespread voting rights for women in national elections were not achieved until after World War I, and in France not until 1945.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0129"><p>Beyond these concrete accomplishments, the movement prompted an unprecedented discussion about the role of women in modern society. In Henrik Ibsen’s play <em>A Doll’s House</em> (1879), the heroine, Nora, finding herself in a loveless and oppressive marriage, leaves both her husband and her children. European audiences were riveted, and many were outraged. Writers, doctors, and journalists addressed previously taboo sexual topics, including homosexuality and birth control. Socialists too found themselves divided about women’s issues. Did the women’s movement distract from the class solidarity that Marxism proclaimed, or did it provide added energy to the workers’ cause? Feminists themselves disagreed about the proper basis for women’s rights. Some took their stand on the modern idea of human equality: “Whatever is right for a man is right for a woman.” Others, particularly in France, based their claims more on the distinctive role of women as mothers. “It is above all this holy function of motherhood,” wrote one advocate of “maternal feminism,” “which requires that women watch over the futures of their children and gives women the right to intervene not only in all acts of civil life, but also in all acts of political life.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-007_25">25</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p035y"><p>It’s important to recognize that as with all major movements promoting social change, feminism had opposition.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0130"><p>Not surprisingly, feminism provoked bitter opposition. Some academic and medical experts argued that the strains of education and life outside the home would cause serious reproductive damage and as a consequence depopulate the nation. Thus feminists were viewed as selfish, willing to sacrifice the family or even the nation while pursuing their individual goals. Some saw suffragists, like Jews and socialists, as “a foreign body in our national life.” Never before in any society had such a passionate and public debate about the position of women erupted. It was a novel feature of Western historical experience in the aftermath of the Atlantic revolutions.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0140"><p>Like nationalism, a concern with women’s rights spread beyond Western Europe and the United States, though less widely. An overtly feminist newspaper was established in Brazil in 1852, and an independent school for girls was founded in Mexico in 1869. A handful of Japanese women and men, including the empress Haruko, raised issues about marriage, family planning, and especially education as the country began its modernizing process after 1868, but the state soon cracked down firmly, forbidding women from joining political parties or even attending political meetings. In Russia, the most radical feminist activists operated within socialist or anarchist circles, targeting the oppressive tsarist regime. Within the Islamic world and in China, some modernists came to believe that education and a higher status for women strengthened the nation in its struggles for development and independence and therefore deserved support. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch16_16.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Kartini</span> for an example from the Dutch East Indies.) Huda Sharawi, founder of the first feminist organization in Egypt, returned to Cairo in 1923 from an international conference in Italy and threw her veil into the sea. Many uppe<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>class Egyptian women soon followed her example.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_727"><p>727</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p0141"><p>Nowhere did nineteenth-century feminism have thoroughly revolutionary consequences. But as an outgrowth of the French and Industrial Revolutions, it raised issues that echoed repeatedly and more loudly in the century that followed.</p></div>
