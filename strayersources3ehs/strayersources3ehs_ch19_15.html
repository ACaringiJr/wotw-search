<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0103"><p>For 250 years prior to Perry’s arrival, Japan had been governed by a shogun (a military ruler) from the Tokugawa family who acted in the name of a revered but powerless emperor, who lived in Kyoto, 300 miles away from the seat of power in Edo (Tokyo). The chief task of this Tokugawa shogunate was to prevent the return of civil war among some 260 rival feudal lords, known as daimyo, each of whom had a cadre of armed retainers, the famed samurai warriors of Japanese tradition.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0104"><p>Based on their own military power and political skills, successive shoguns gave Japan more than two centuries of internal peace (1600–1850). To control the restive daimyo, they required these local authorities to create second homes in Edo, the country’s capital, where they had to live during alternate years. When they left for their rural residences, families stayed behind, almost as hostages. Nonetheless, the daimyo, especially the more powerful ones, retained substantial autonomy in their own domains and behaved in some ways like independent states with separate military forces, law codes, tax systems, and currencies. With no national army, no uniform currency, and little central authority at the local level, Tokugawa Japan was “pacified … but not really unified.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-007_11">11</span> To further stabilize the country, the Tokugawa regime issued highly detailed rules governing the occupation, residence, dress, hairstyles, and behavior of the four hierarchically ranked status groups into which Japanese society was divided — samurai at the top, then peasants, artisans, and, at the bottom, merchants.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0105"><p>Much was changing within Japan during these 250 years of peace in ways that belied the control and orderliness of Tokugawa regulations. For one thing, the samurai, in the absence of wars to fight, evolved into a salaried bureaucratic or administrative class amounting to 5 to 6 percent of the total population, but they were still fiercely devoted to their daimyo lords and to their warrior code of loyalty, honor, and self-sacrifice.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0108"><p>In what ways was Japan changing during the Tokugawa era?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0106"><p>More generally, centuries of peace contributed to a remarkable burst of economic growth, commercialization, and urban development. Entrepreneurial peasants, using fertilizers and other agricultural innovations, grew more rice than ever before and engaged in a variety of rural manufacturing enterprises as well. By 1750, Japan had become perhaps the world’s most urbanized country, with about 10 percent of its population living in sizable towns or cities. Edo, with perhaps a million residents, was among the world’s largest cities. Well-functioning networks of exchange linked urban and rural areas, marking Japan as an emerging market economy. The influence of Confucianism encouraged education and generated a remarkably literate population, with about 40 percent of men and 15 percent of women able to read and write. Although no one was aware of it at the time, these changes during the Tokugawa era provided a solid foundation for Japan’s remarkable industrial growth in the late nineteenth century.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0109"><p>Such changes also undermined the shogunate’s efforts to freeze Japanese society in the interests of stability. Some samurai found the lowly but profitable path of commerce too much to resist. “No more shall we have to live by the sword,” declared one of them in 1616 while renouncing his samurai status. “I have seen that great profit can be made honorably. I shall brew <em>sake</em> and soy sauce, and we shall prosper.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-007_12">12</span> Many merchants, though hailing from the lowest-ranking status group, prospered in the new commercial environment and supported a vibrant urban culture, while not a few daimyo found it necessary, if humiliating, to seek loans from these social inferiors. Thus merchants had money, but little status, whereas samurai enjoyed high status but were often indebted to inferior merchants. Both resented their positions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0110"><p>Despite prohibitions to the contrary, many peasants moved to the cities, becoming artisans or merchants and imitating the ways of their social betters. A decree of 1788 noted that peasants “have become accustomed to luxury and forgetful of their status.” They wore inappropriate clothing, used umbrellas rather than straw hats in the rain, and even left the villages for the city. “Henceforth,” declared the shogun, “all luxuries should be avoided by the peasants. They are to live simply and devote themselves to farming.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-007_13">13</span> This decree, like many others before it, was widely ignored.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0111"><p>More than social change undermined the Tokugawa regime. Corruption was widespread, to the disgust of many. The shogunate’s failure to deal successfully with a severe famine in the 1830s eroded confidence in its effectiveness. At the same time, a mounting wave of local peasant uprisings and urban riots expressed the many grievances of the poor. The most striking of these outbursts left the city of Osaka in flames in 1837. Its leader, Oshio Heihachiro, no doubt spoke for many ordinary people when he wrote:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_854"><p>854</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0112"><p>We must first punish the officials who torment the people so cruelly; then we must execute the haughty and rich Osaka merchants. Then we must distribute the gold, silver, and copper stored in their cellars, and bands of rice hidden in their storehouses.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-007_14">14</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0113"><p>From the 1830s on, one historian concluded, “there was a growing feeling that the <em>shogunate</em> was losing control.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-007_15">15</span></p></div>
