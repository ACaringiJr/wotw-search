<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p074"><p>In what different ways did the Ottoman state respond to its various problems?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p072"><p>Ottoman reforms began in the late eighteenth century when Sultan Selim III sought to reorganize and update the army, drawing on European advisers and techniques. Even these modest innovations stirred the hostility of powerful factions among both the <em>ulama</em> (religious scholars) and the elite military corps of Janissaries, who saw them in conflict with both Islam and their own institutional interests. Opposition to his measures was so strong that Selim was overthrown in 1807 and then murdered. Subsequent sultans, however, crushed the Janissaries and brought the ulama more thoroughly under state control than elsewhere in the Islamic world.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p035g"><p>You need to know about the goals and outcomes of the Tanzimat reforms.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p075"><p>Then, in the several decades after 1839, more far-reaching reformist measures, known as Tanzimat (tahn-zee-MAHT) (reorganization), took shape as the Ottoman leadership sought to provide the economic, social, and legal underpinnings for a strong and newly recentralized state. Factories producing cloth, paper, and armaments; modern mining operations; reclamation and resettlement of agricultural land; telegraphs, steamships, railroads, and a modern postal service; Western-style law codes and courts; new elementary and secondary schools — all of these new departures began a long process of modernization and westernization in the Ottoman Empire.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p076"><p>Even more revolutionary, at least in principle, were changes in the legal status of the empire’s diverse communities, which now gave non-Muslims equal rights under the law. An imperial proclamation of 1856 declared:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p077"><p>Every distinction or designation tending to make any class whatever of the subjects of my Empire inferior to another class, on account of their religion, language or race shall be forever effaced…. No subject of my Empire shall be hindered in the exercise of the religion that he professes…. All the subjects of my Empire, without distinction of nationality, shall be admissible to public employment.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p078"><p>This declaration represented a dramatic change that challenged the fundamentally Islamic character of the state. Mixed tribunals with representatives from various religious groups were established to hear cases involving non-Muslims. More Christians were appointed to high office. A mounting tide of secular legislation and secular schools, drawing heavily on European models, now competed with traditional Islamic institutions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p079"><p>Although Tanzimat-era reforms did not directly address gender issues, they did stimulate modest educational openings for women, mostly in Istanbul, with a training program for midwives in 1842, a girls’ secondary school in 1858, and a teacher training college for women in 1870. Furthermore, the reform-minded class that emerged from the Tanzimat era generally favored greater opportunities for women as a means of strengthening the state, and a number of upper- and middle-class women were involved in these discussions. During the 1870s and 1880s, the prominent female poet Sair Nigar Hanim held weekly “salons” in which reformist intellectuals of both sexes participated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p080"><p>The reform process raised profound and highly contested questions. What was the Ottoman Empire, and who were its people? Were they Ottoman subjects of a dynastic state, Turkish citizens of a national state, or Muslim believers in a religiously defined state? For decades, the answers oscillated as few people wanted to choose decisively among these alternative identities.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-hd1" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p082"><p><span data-block_type="sq_mrk">▪</span><strong>COMPARISON</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p083"><p>In what different ways did various groups define the Ottoman Empire during the nineteenth century?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p081"><p>To those who supported the reforms, the Ottoman Empire was an inclusive state, all of whose people were loyal to the dynasty that ruled it. This was the outlook of a new class spawned by the reform process itself — lower-level officials, military officers, writers, poets, and journalists, many of whom had a modern Western-style education. Dubbed the Young Ottomans, they were active during the middle decades of the nineteenth century, as they sought major changes in the Ottoman political system itself. They favored a more European-style parliamentary and constitutional regime that could curtail the absolute power of the sultan. Only such a political system, they felt, could mobilize the energies of the country to overcome backwardness and preserve the state against European aggression. Known as Islamic modernism, such ideas found expression in many parts of the Muslim world in the second half of the century. Muslim societies, the Young Ottomans argued, needed to embrace Western technical and scientific knowledge, while rejecting its materialism. Islam in their view could accommodate a full modernity without sacrificing its essential religious character. After all, the Islamic world had earlier hosted impressive scientific achievements and had incorporated elements of Greek philosophical thinking.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p084"><p>In 1876, the Young Ottomans experienced a short-lived victory when Sultan Abd al-Hamid II (r. 1876–1909) accepted a constitution and an elected parliament, but not for long. Under the pressure of war with Russia, the sultan soon suspended the reforms and reverted to an older style of despotic rule for the next thirty years, even renewing the claim that he was the caliph, the successor to the Prophet and the protector of Muslims everywhere.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p085"><p>Opposition to this revived despotism soon surfaced among both military and civilian elites known as the Young Turks. Largely abandoning any reference to Islam, they advocated a militantly secular public life, were committed to thorough modernization along European lines, and increasingly thought about the Ottoman Empire as a Turkish national state. “There is only one civilization, and that is European civilization,” declared Abdullah Cevdet, a prominent figure in the Young Turk movement. “Therefore we must borrow western civilization with both its rose and its thorn.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-005_10">10</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p086"><p>A military coup in 1908 finally allowed the Young Turks to exercise real power. They pushed for a radical secularization of schools, courts, and law codes; permitted elections and competing parties; established a single Law of Family Rights for all regardless of religion; and encouraged Turkish as the official language of the empire. They also opened modern schools for women, including access to Istanbul University; allowed women to wear Western clothing; restricted polygamy; and permitted women to obtain divorces in some situations. Women established a number of publications and organizations, some of them linked to British suffrage groups. In the western cities of the empire, some women abandoned their veils.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p087"><p>But the nationalist Turkish conception of Ottoman identity antagonized non-Turkic peoples and helped stimulate Arab and other nationalisms in response. For some, a secular nationality was becoming the most important public loyalty, with Islam relegated to private life. Nationalist sentiments contributed to the complete disintegration of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, but the secularizing and westernizing principles of the Young Turks informed the policies of the Turkish republic that replaced it.</p></div>
