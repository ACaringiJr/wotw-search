<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0136"><p>The impressive growth of Chinese Buddhism was accompanied by a persistent undercurrent of resistance and criticism. Some saw the Buddhist establishment, at least potentially, as a “state within a state” and a challenge to imperial authority. More important was a deepening resentment of its enormous wealth. One fifth-century critic, referring to monks, put the issue squarely: “Why is it that their ideals are noble and far-reaching and their activities still are base and common? [They] become merchants and engage in barter, wrangling with the masses for profit.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-012_33">33</span> Nor did the environmental impact of Buddhist monasteries escape the notice of state officials. In 707 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, one such official wrote: “Extensive construction of monasteries are undertaken and large mansions are built. Even though for such works trees are felled to the point of stripping the mountains, it does not suffice…. Though earth is moved to the point of obstructing roads, it does not suffice.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-012_34">34</span> When state treasuries were short of funds, government officials cast a covetous eye on these wealthy and tax-exempt monasteries. Furthermore, Buddhism was clearly of foreign origin and offensive for that reason to some Confucian and Daoist thinkers. The celibacy of the monks and their withdrawal from society, the critics argued, undermined the Confucian-based family system of Chinese tradition.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0138"><p>What were the major sources of opposition to Buddhism within China?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0139"><p>Such criticisms took on new meaning in the changed environment of China after about 800 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> Following centuries of considerable foreign influence in China, a growing resentment against foreign culture, particularly among the literate classes, increasingly took hold. The turning point may well have been the An Lushan rebellion (755–763), in which a general of foreign origin led a major revolt against the Tang dynasty. Whatever its origin, an increasingly xenophobic reaction set in among the upper classes, reflected in a desire to return to an imagined “purity” of earlier times. In this setting, the old criticisms of Buddhism became more sharply focused. In 819, Han Yu, a leading figure in the Confucian counterattack on Buddhism, wrote a scathing memorial to the emperor, criticizing his willingness to honor a relic of the Buddha’s finger.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0140"><p>Now the Buddha was of barbarian origin. His language differed from Chinese speech; his clothes were of a different cut; his mouth did not pronounce the prescribed words of the Former Kings…. He did not recognize the relationship between prince and subject, nor the sentiments of father and son…. I pray that Your Majesty will turn this bone over to the officials that it may be cast into water or fire.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-012_35">35</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_353"><p>353</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0141"><p>Several decades later, the Chinese state took direct action against the Buddhist establishment as well as against other foreign religions. A series of imperial decrees between 841 and 845 ordered some 260,000 monks and nuns to return to normal life as tax-paying citizens. Thousands of monasteries, temples, and shrines were either destroyed or turned to public use, while the state confiscated the lands, money, metals, and serfs belonging to monasteries. Buddhists were now forbidden to use gold, silver, copper, iron, and gems in constructing their images. These actions dealt a serious blow to Chinese Buddhism. Its scholars and monks were scattered, its creativity diminished, and its institutions came even more firmly under state control.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0142"><p>Despite this persecution, Buddhism did not vanish from China. At the level of elite culture, its philosophical ideas played a role in the reformulation of Confucian thinking that took place during the Song dynasty. At the village level, Buddhism became one element of Chinese popular religion, which also included the veneration of ancestors, the honoring of Confucius, and Daoist shrines and rituals. Temples frequently included statues of Confucius, Laozi, and the Buddha, with little sense of any incompatibility among them. “Every black-haired son of Han,” the Chinese have long said, “wears a Confucian thinking cap, a Daoist robe, and Buddhist sandals.” (See <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch4/STR_02272_04_P01.html" data-target="_pop">the opening photo for Chapter 4</span>.) Unlike in Europe, where an immigrant religion triumphed over and excluded all other faiths, Buddhism in China became assimilated into Chinese culture alongside its other traditions.</p></div>
