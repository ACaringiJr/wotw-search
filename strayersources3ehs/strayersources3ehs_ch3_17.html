<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0133"><p>Among the secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations of Eurasia, empire loomed large in Persian, Mediterranean, and Chinese history, but it played a rather less prominent role in Indian history. In the Indus River valley flourished the largest of the First Civilizations, embodied in exquisitely planned cities such as Harappa but with little evidence of any central political authority (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch2_2.html">Chapter 2</span>). The demise of this early civilization by 1500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> was followed over the next thousand years by the creation of a new civilization based farther east, along the Ganges River on India’s northern plain. That process has occasioned considerable debate, which has focused on the role of the Aryans, a pastoral Ind<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>European people long thought to have invaded and destroyed the Indus Valley civilization and then created the new one along the Ganges. More recent research questions this interpretation. Did the Aryans invade suddenly, or did they migrate slowly into the Indus River valley? Were they already there as a part of the Indus Valley population? Was the new civilization largely the work of Aryans, or did it evolve gradually from Indus Valley culture? Scholars have yet to reach agreement on any of these questions.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec1-003_17">17</span></p></div>

Politically, that civilization emerged as a fragmented collection of towns and cities, some small republics governed by public assemblies, and a number of regional states ruled by kings. An astonishing range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity also characterized this civilization, as an endless variety of peoples migrated into India from Central Asia across the mountain passes in the northwest. These features of Indian civilization — political fragmentation and vast cultural diversity — have informed much of South Asian history throughout many centuries, offering a sharp contrast to the pattern of development in China. What gave Indian civilization a recognizable identity and character was neither an imperial tradition nor ethno-linguistic commonality, but rather a distinctive religious tradition, known later to outsiders as Hinduism, and a unique social organization, the caste system. These features of Indian life are explored further in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch4_2.html">Chapters 4</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch5_2.html">5</span>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0137"><p>Nonetheless, empires and emperors were not entirely unknown in India’s long history.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0138"><p>The Mauryan Empire was an impressive political structure, equivalent to the Persian, Chinese, and Roman empires, though not nearly as lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>lasting. With a population of perhaps 50 million, the Mauryan Empire boasted a large military force, reported to include 600,000 infantry soldiers, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots, and 9,000 elephants. A civilian bureaucracy featured various ministries and a large contingent of spies to provide the rulers with local information. A famous treatise called the <em>Arthashastra</em> (<em>The Science of Worldly Wealth</em>) articulated a pragmatic, even amoral, political philosophy for Mauryan rulers. It was, according to one scholar, a book that showed “how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec1-003_18">18</span> The state also operated many industries — spinning, weaving, mining, shipbuilding, and armaments. This complex apparatus was financed by taxes on trade, on herds of animals, and especially on land, from which the monarch claimed a quarter or more of the crop.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0139"><p>Mauryan India is perhaps best known for one of its emperors, Ashoka (r. 268–232 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>), who left a record of his activities and his thinking in a series of edicts carved on rocks and pillars throughout the kingdom. Ashoka’s conversion to Buddhism and his moralistic approach to governance gave his reign a different tone than that of China’s Shihuangdi or Greece’s Alexander the Great, who, according to legend, wept because he had no more worlds to conquer. Ashoka’s legacy to modern India has been that of an enlightened ruler, who sought to govern in accord with the religious values and moral teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0140"><p>Despite their good intentions, these policies did not long preserve the empire, which broke apart soon after Ashoka’s death. About 600 years later, a second brief imperial experiment, known as the Gupta Empire (320–550 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), took shape. Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist traveler in India at the time, noted a generally peaceful, tolerant, and prosperous land, commenting that the ruler “governs without decapitation or corporal punishment.” Free hospitals, he reported, were available to “the destitute, crippled and diseased,” but he also noticed “untouchables” carrying bells to warn upper-caste people of their polluting presence.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec1-003_19">19</span> Culturally, the Gupta era witnessed a flourishing of art, literature, temple building, science, mathematics, and medicine, much of it patronized by rulers. Indian trade with China also thrived, and elements of Buddhist and Hindu culture took root in Southeast Asia (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch7_2.html">Chapter 7</span>). Indian commerce reached as far as the Roman world.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0141"><p>Thus India’s political history resembled that of Western Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire far more than that of China or Persia. Neither imperial nor regional states commanded the kind of loyalty or exercised the degree of influence that they did in other second-wave civilizations. India’s unparalleled cultural diversity surely was one reason, as was the frequency of invasions from Central Asia, which repeatedly smashed emerging states that might have provided the nucleus for an all-India empire. Finally, India’s social structure, embodied in a caste system linked to occupational groups, made for intensely local loyalties at the expense of wider identities (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch5_2.html">Chapter 5</span>).</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p0142"><p>Nonetheless, a frequently vibrant economy fostered a lively internal commerce and made India the focal point of an extensive network of trade in the Indian Ocean basin. In particular, its cotton textile industry long supplied cloth throughout the Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasian world. Strong guilds of merchants and artisans provided political leadership in major towns and cities, and their wealth supported lavish temples, public buildings, and religious festivals. Great creativity in religious matters generated Hindu and Buddhist traditions that later penetrated much of Asia. Indian mathematics and science, especially astronomy, were also impressive; Indian scientists plotted the movements of stars and planets and recognized quite early that the earth was round. Clearly, the absence of consistent imperial unity did not prevent the evolution of a lasting civilization.</p></div>
