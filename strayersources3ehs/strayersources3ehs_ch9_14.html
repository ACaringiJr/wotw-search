<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p091"><p>What did the rise of Islam and the making of the Arab Empire mean for the daily lives of women and their relationship with men? Virtually every aspect of this question has been and remains highly controversial. The debates begin with the Quran itself. Did its teachings release women from earlier restrictions, or did they impose new limitations? At the level of spiritual life, the Quran was quite clear and explicit: men and women were equal. Numerous passages in the Quran use gende<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>inclusive language, referring to “believers, both men and women.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p092"><p>Those who surrender themselves to Allah and accept the true faith; who are devout, sincere, patient, humble, charitable, and chaste; who fast and are ever mindful of Allah — on these, both men and women, Allah will bestow forgiveness and rich reward.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch09-sec2-007_15">15</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p095"><p>But in social terms, and especially within marriage, the Quran, like the written texts of almost all civilizations, viewed women as inferior and subordinate: “Men have authority over women because Allah has made the one superior to the other, and because they spend their wealth to maintain them. Good women are obedient.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch09-sec2-007_16">16</span> More specifically, the Quran provided a mix of rights, restrictions, and protections for women. Female infanticide, for example, widely practiced in many cultures as a means of gender selection, was now forbidden for Muslims. Women were given control over their own property, particularly their dowries, and were granted rights of inheritance, but at half the rate of their male counterparts. Marriage was considered a contract between consenting parties, thus making marriage by capture illegitimate. Divorce was possible for both parties, although it was far more readily available for men. The practice of taking multiple husbands, which operated in some pr<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>Islamic Arab tribes, was prohibited, while polygyny (the practice of having multiple wives) was permitted, though more clearly regulated than before. Men were limited to four wives and required to treat each of them equally. (The difficulty of doing so has been interpreted by some as virtually requiring monogamy.) Men were, however, permitted to have sexual relations with female slaves, but any children born of those unions were free, as was the mother once her owner died. Furthermore, men were strongly encouraged to marry orphans, widows, and slaves.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p096"><p>Such Quranic prescriptions were but one factor shaping the lives of women and men. At least as important were the long-established practices of the societies into which Islam spread and the growing sophistication, prosperity, and urbanization of Islamic civilization. As had been the case in Athens and China during their “golden ages,” Muslim women, particularly in the upper classes, experienced growing restrictions as Islamic civilization flourished culturally and economically in the Abbasid era. In early Islamic times, a number of women played visible public roles, particularly Muhammad’s youngest wife, Aisha. Women prayed in the mosques, although separately, standing beside the men. Nor were women generally veiled or secluded. As the Arab Empire grew in size and splendor, however, the position of women became more limited. The second caliph, Umar, asked women to offer prayers at home. Now veiling and the seclusion of women became standard practice among the upper and ruling classes, removing them from public life. Separate quarters within the homes of the wealthy were the domain of women, from which they could emerge only completely veiled. The caliph Mansur (r. 754–775) carried this separation of the sexes even further when he ordered a separate bridge for women to be built over the Euphrates River in the new capital of Baghdad. Such seclusion was less possible for lower-class women, who lacked the servants of the rich and had to leave the home for shopping or work.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p097"><p>Such practices derived far more from established traditions of Middle Eastern cultures than from the Quran itself, but they soon gained an Islamic rationale in the writings of Muslim thinkers. The famous philosopher and religious scholar al-Ghazali clearly saw a relationship between Muslim piety and the separation of the sexes:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p098"><p>It is not permissible for a stranger to hear the sound of a pestle being pounded by a woman he does not know. If he knocks at the door, it is not proper for the woman to answer him softly and easily because men’s hearts can be drawn to [women] for the most trifling [reason]…. However, if the woman has to answer the knock, she should stick her finger in her mouth so that her voice sounds like that of an old woman.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch09-sec2-007_17">17</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p099"><p>Other signs of a tightening patriarchy — such as “honor killing” of women by their male relatives for violating sexual taboos and, in some places, clitoridectomy (female genital cutting) — likewise derived from local cultures, with no sanction in the Quran or Islamic law. Where they were practiced, such customs often came to be seen as Islamic, but they were certainly not limited to the Islamic world. In many cultures, concern with family honor linked to women’s sexuality dictated harsh punishments for women who violated sexual taboos.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_382"><p>382</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0100"><p>Negative views of women, presenting them variously as weak, deficient, and a sexually charged threat to men and social stability, emerged in the <em>hadiths</em> (hah-DEETHS), traditions about the sayings or actions of Muhammad, which became an important source of Islamic law. A changing interpretation of the Adam and Eve story illustrates the point. The Quran attaches equal blame to both Adam and Eve for yielding to the temptation of Satan, and both alike ask for and receive God’s forgiveness. Nothing suggests that Eve tempted or seduced Adam into sin. In later centuries, however, several hadiths and other writings took up Judeo-Christian versions of the story that blamed Eve, and thus women in general, for Adam’s sin and for the punishment that followed, including expulsion from the garden and pain in childbirth.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch09-sec2-007_18">18</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0101"><p>Even as women faced growing restrictions in society generally, Islam, like Buddhism and Christianity, also offered new outlets for them in religious life. The Sufi practice of mystical union with Allah allowed a greater role for women than did mainstream Islam. Some Sufi orders had parallel groups for women, and a few welcomed women as equal members. Among the earliest of well-known Sufi practitioners was Rabia, an eighth-century woman from Basra in southern Iraq, who renounced numerous proposals of marriage and engaged, apparently successfully, in repeated religious debates with men. The greatest of the Sufi scholars, Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240), sang the praises of divine beauty in an explicitly feminine form. The spiritual equality that the Quran accorded to male and female alike allowed women also to aspire to union with God. But for some male Sufi scholars, such as the twelfth-century mystical poet Attar, doing so meant that “she is a man and one cannot any more call her a woman.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch09-sec2-007_19">19</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0102"><p>Beyond Sufi practice, within the world of Shia Islam, women teachers of the faith were called mullahs, the same as their male counterparts. Islamic education, either in the home or in Quranic schools, allowed some to become literate and a few to achieve higher levels of learning. Visits to the tombs of major Islamic figures as well as the ritual of the public bath likewise provided some opportunity for women to interact with other women beyond their own family circle.</p></div>
