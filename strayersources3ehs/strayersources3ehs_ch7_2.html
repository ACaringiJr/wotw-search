I placed my order online…. I was astonished by what followed. I received a confirmation <span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>mail within minutes … [and learned that] the product was being shipped not from California but from Shanghai, China…. Ateesh’s personalized iPod landed on our New Haven [Connecticut] doorstep barely 40 hours after I had clicked ‘Buy.’”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch07-sec1-1_1">1</span> To Nayan Chanda, a fift<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>eigh<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>yea<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>old journalist, born and educated in India and at the time working at Yale University, this was an astonishing transaction. Probably it was less surprising to his son. But both of them, no doubt, understood this kind of commercial exchange as something quite recent in human history.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-intr" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p021"><p>And in the speed of the transaction, it surely was. But from the perspective of world history, exchange among distant peoples is not altogether new, and the roots of economic globalization lie deep in the past. In fact, just three years after purchasing his son’s iPod, Nayan Chanda wrote a wel<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>received book titled <em>Bound Together</em>, describing how traders, preachers, adventurers, and warriors had long created links among peoples living in widely separated cultures and civilizations. Those early transregional interactions and their capacity for transforming human societies, for better and for worse, played an increasingly significant role in this era of thir<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations, a millennium of accelerating connections.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p022"><p><span data-block_type="drop">T</span> he exchange of goods among communities occupying different ecological zones has long been a prominent feature of human history. Coastlands and highlands, steppes and farmlands, islands and mainlands, valleys and mountains, deserts and forests — each generates different products. Furthermore, some societies have been able to monopolize, at least temporarily, the production of particular products — such as silk in China, certain spices in Southeast Asia, and incense in southern Arabia — that others have found valuable. This uneven distribution of goods and resources, whether natural or resulting from human activity, has long motivated exchange, not only within particular civilizations or regions but among them as well. In the world of 500 to 1500, lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>distance trade became more important than ever before in linking and shaping distant societies and peoples. For the most part, it was indirect, a chain of separate transactions in which goods traveled farther than individual merchants. Nonetheless, a network of exchange and communication extending all across the Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasian world, and separately in parts of the Americas as well, slowly came into being.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p035a"><p>You must know the political, social, and economic effects of networks of exchange.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p023"><p>Why was trade important? How did it generate change within the societies that it connected? Economically speaking, commerce often altered consumption and shaped daily life. West Africans, for example, imported scarce salt, necessary for human diets and useful for seasoning and preserving food, from distant mines in the Sahara in exchange for the gold of their region. Over several millennia, incense such as frankincense and myrrh, grown in southern Arabia and the adjacent region of northern Somalia, found eager consumers in ancient Egypt and Babylon, India and China, Greece and Rome. Used for medicinal purposes, religious ceremonies, and as an antidote to the odors of unsanitary cities, incense also bore the “aroma of eros.” “I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon,” declared a harlot featured in the Old Testament book of Proverbs. “Come, let us take our fill of love till morning.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch07-sec1-1_2">2</span> Trade also affected the working lives of many people, encouraging them to specialize in producing particular products for sale in distant markets rather than for use in their own communities.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p024"><p>Trade, in short, diminished the economic self-sufficiency of local societies, even as it altered the structure of those societies as well. Merchants often became a distinct social group, viewed with suspicion by others because of their impulse to accumulate wealth without actually producing anything themselves. In some societies, trade became a means of social mobility, as Chinese merchants, for example, were able to purchase landed estates and establish themselves within the gentry class. Long-distance trade also enabled elite groups in society to distinguish themselves from commoners by acquiring prestigious goods from a distance — silk, tortoiseshell, jade, rhinoceros horn, or particular feathers. The association with faraway or powerful societies, signaled by the possession of their luxury goods, often conveyed status in communities more remote from major civilizations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p025"><p>Trade also had the capacity to transform political life. The wealth available from controlling and taxing trade motivated the creation of states in various parts of the world and sustained those states once they had been constructed. Furthermore, commerce posed a set of problems to governments everywhere. Should trade be left in private hands, as in the Aztec Empire, or should it be controlled by the state, as in the Inca Empire? How should state authorities deal with men of commerce, who were both economically useful and potentially disruptive?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_283"><p>283</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p027"><p>Moreover, the saddlebags of camel caravans or the cargo holds of merchant vessels carried more than goods. Trade became a vehicle for the spread of religious ideas, technological innovations, disease-bearing germs, and plants and animals to regions far from their places of origin. In just this fashion, Buddhism made its way from India to Central and East Asia, and Islam crossed the Sahara into West Africa. So did the pathogens that devastated much of Eurasia during the Black Death. These immense cultural and biological transformations were among the most significant outcomes of the increasingly dense network of long-distance commerce during the era of third-wave civilizations.</p></div>
