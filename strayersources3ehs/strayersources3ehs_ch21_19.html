</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p0136"><p>More rapidly than its beginning, and far more peacefully, the communist era came to an end during the last twenty years of the twentieth century. It was a drama in three acts. Act One began in China during the late 1970s, following the death of its towering revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in 1976. Over the next several decades, the CCP gradually abandoned almost everything that had been associated with Maoist communism, even as the party retained its political control of the country. Act Two took place in Eastern Europe in the “miracle year” of 1989, when popular movements toppled despised communist governments one after another all across the region. The climactic Act Three in this “end of communism” drama occurred in 1991 in the Soviet Union, where the entire “play” had opened sevent<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>four years earlier. There the reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev (GOR<span data-block_type="nobr">E-</span><wbr/>be<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>CHOF) had come to power in 1985 intending to revive and save Soviet socialism from its accumulated dysfunctions. Those efforts, however, only exacerbated the country’s many difficulties and led to the political disintegration of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991. The curtain had fallen on the communist era and on the cold war as well.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p0139"><p>Behind these separate stories lay two general failures of the communist experiment, measured both by their own standards and by those of the larger world. The first was economic. Despite their early successes, communist economies by the late 1970s showed no signs of catching up to the more advanced capitalist countries. The highly regimented Soviet economy in particular was largely stagnant; its citizens were forced to stand in long lines for consumer goods and complained endlessly about their poor quality and declining availability. This was enormously embarrassing, for it had been the proud boast of communist leaders everywhere that they had found a better route to modern prosperity than their capitalist rivals had. Furthermore, these comparisons were increasingly well known, thanks to the global information revolution. This failure had security implications as well, for economic growth, even more than military capacity, was the measure of state power as the twentieth century approached its end.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_959"><p>959</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p0140"><p>The second failure was moral. The horrors of Stalin’s Terror and the gulag, of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, of something approaching genocide in communist Cambodia — all of this wore away at communist claims to moral superiority over capitalism. Moreover, this erosion occurred as global political culture more widely embraced democracy and human rights as the universal legacy of humankind, rather than the exclusive possession of the capitalist West. In both economic and moral terms, the communist path to the modern world was increasingly seen as a road to nowhere.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p0141"><p>Communist leaders were not ignorant of these problems, and they moved aggressively to address them, particularly in China and the Soviet Union. But their approach to doing so varied greatly, as did the outcomes of those efforts. Thus, much as the Russian and Chinese revolutions differed and their approaches to building socialism diverged, so too did these communist giants chart distinct paths during the final years of the communist experiment.</p></div>
