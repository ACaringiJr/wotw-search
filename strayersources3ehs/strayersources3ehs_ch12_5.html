</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p028"><p>Despite millennia of agricultural advance, substantial areas of the world still hosted gathering and hunting societies, known to historians as Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) peoples. All of Australia, much of Siberia, the arctic coastlands, and parts of Africa and the Americas fell into this category. These peoples were not simply relics of a bygone age. They too had changed over time, though more slowly than their agricultural counterparts, and they too interacted with their neighbors. In short, they had a history, although most history books largely ignore them after the age of agriculture arrived. Nonetheless, this most ancient way of life still had a sizable and variable presence in the world of the fifteenth century.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p035b"><p>Make sure you are aware of common features of Paleolithic societies.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p030"><p>Consider, for example, Australia. That continent’s many separate groups, some 250 of them, still practiced a gathering and hunting way of life in the fifteenth century, a pattern that continued well after Europeans arrived in the late eighteenth century. Over many thousands of years, these people had assimilated various material items or cultural practices from outsiders — outrigger canoes, fishhooks, complex netting techniques, artistic styles, rituals, and mythological ideas — but despite the presence of farmers in nearby New Guinea, no agricultural practices penetrated the Australian mainland. Was it because large areas of Australia were unsuited for the kind of agriculture practiced in New Guinea? Or did the peoples of Australia, enjoying an environment of sufficient resources, simply see no need to change their way of life?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p033"><p>Despite the absence of agriculture, Australia’s peoples had mastered and manipulated their environment, in part through the practice of “firestick farming,” a pattern of deliberately set fires, which they described as “cleaning up the country.” These controlled burns served to clear the underbrush, thus making hunting easier and encouraging the growth of certain plant and animal species. In addition, native Australians exchanged goods among themselves over distances of hundreds of miles, created elaborate mythologies and ritual practices, and developed sophisticated traditions of sculpture and rock painting. They accomplished all of this on the basis of an economy and technology rooted in the distant Paleolithic past.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_502"><p>502</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p034"><p>A very different kind of gathering and hunting society flourished in the fifteenth century along the northwest coast of North America among the Chinookan, Tulalip, Skagit, and other peoples. With some 300 edible animal species and an abundance of salmon and other fish, this extraordinarily bounteous environment provided the foundation for what scholars sometimes call “complex” or “affluent” gathering and hunting cultures. What distinguished the northwest coast peoples from those of Australia were permanent village settlements with large and sturdy houses, considerable economic specialization, ranked societies that sometimes included slavery, chiefdoms dominated by powerful clan leaders or “big men,” and extensive storage of food.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p035"><p>Although these and other gathering and hunting peoples persisted still in the fifteenth century, both their numbers and the area they inhabited had contracted greatly as the Agricultural Revolution unfolded across the planet. That relentless advance of the farming frontier continued in the centuries ahead as the Russian, Chinese, and European empires encompassed the lands of the remaining Paleolithic peoples. By the early twenty-first century, what was once the only human way of life had been reduced to minuscule pockets of people whose cultures seemed doomed to a final extinction.</p></div>
