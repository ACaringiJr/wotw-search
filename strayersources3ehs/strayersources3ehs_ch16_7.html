<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p039"><p>Act Two in the drama of the Atlantic revolutions took place in France, beginning in 1789, although it was closely connected to Act One in North America. Thousands of French soldiers had provided assistance to the American colonists and now returned home full of republican enthusiasm. Thomas Jefferson, the U.S. ambassador in Paris, reported that France “has been awakened by our revolution.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-002_6">6</span> More immediately, the French government, which had generously aided the Americans in an effort to undermine its British rivals, was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and had long sought reforms that would modernize the tax system and make it more equitable. In a desperate effort to raise taxes against the opposition of the privileged classes, the French king, Louis XVI, had called into session an ancient representative body, the Estates General. It consisted of male representatives of the three “estates,” or legal orders, of prerevolutionary France: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The first two estates comprised about 2 percent of the population, and the Third Estate included everyone else. When that body convened in 1789, representatives of the Third Estate soon organized themselves as the National Assembly, claiming the sole authority to make laws for the country. A few weeks later, they drew up the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, which forthrightly declared that “men are born and remain free and equal in rights.” These actions, unprecedented and illegal in the <em>ancien régime</em> (the old regime), launched the French Revolution and radicalized many of the participants in the National Assembly.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p042"><p>How did the French Revolution differ from the American Revolution?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p040"><p>The French Revolution was quite different from its North American predecessor. Whereas the American Revolution expressed the tensions of a colonial relationship with a distant imperial power, the French insurrection was driven by sharp conflicts within French society. Members of the titled nobility — privileged, prestigious, and wealthy — resented and resisted the monarchy’s efforts to subject them to new taxes. Educated middle-class men such as doctors, lawyers, lower-level officials, and merchants were growing in numbers and sometimes in wealth and were offended by the remaining privileges of the aristocracy, from which they were excluded. Ordinary urban men and women, many of whose incomes had declined for a generation, were hit particularly hard in the late 1780s by the rapidly rising price of bread and widespread unemployment. Peasants in the countryside, though largely free of serfdom, were subject to hated dues imposed by their landlords, taxes from the state, obligations to the Church, and the requirement to work without pay on public roads. As Enlightenment ideas penetrated French society, more and more people, mostly in the Third Estate but also including some priests and nobles, found a language with which to articulate these grievances. The famous French writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau had told them that it was “manifestly contrary to the law of nature … that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-002_7">7</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p043"><p>These social conflicts gave the French Revolution, especially during its first five years, a much more violent, far-reaching, and radical character than its American counterpart. It was a profound social upheaval, more comparable to the revolutions of Russia and China in the twentieth century than to the earlier American Revolution. Initial efforts to establish a constitutional monarchy and promote harmony among the classes (see <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource161" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 16.1</span>) gave way to more radical measures, as internal resistance and foreign opposition produced a fear that the revolution might be overturned. In the process, urban crowds organized insurrections. Some peasants attacked the residences of their lords, burning the documents that recorded their dues and payments. The National Assembly decreed the end of all legal privileges and eliminated what remained of feudalism in France. Even slavery was abolished, albeit briefly. Church lands were sold to raise revenue, and priests were put under government authority. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="sources162" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Sources 16.2</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="163" data-href="" data-target="_pop">16.3</span>, for images reflecting this more radical phase of the revolution.)</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p044"><p>In 1793, King Louis XVI and his queen, Marie Antoinette, were executed, an act of regicide that shocked traditionalists all across Europe and marked a new stage in revolutionary violence. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="source164" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Source 16.4</span>.) What followed was the Terror of 1793–1794. Under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre (ROHB<span data-block_type="nobr">S-</span><wbr/>pe<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>air) and his Committee of Public Safety, tens of thousands deemed enemies of the revolution lost their lives on the guillotine. Shortly thereafter, Robespierre himself was arrested and guillotined, accused of leading France into tyranny and dictatorship. “The revolution,” remarked one of its victims, “was devouring its own children.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p045"><p>Accompanying attacks on the old order were efforts to create a wholly new society, symbolized by a new calendar with the Year 1 in 1792, marking a fresh start for France. Unlike the Americans, who sought to restore or build on earlier freedoms, French revolutionaries perceived themselves to be starting from scratch and looked to the future. For the first time in its history, the country became a republic and briefly passed universal male suffrage, although it was never implemented. The old administrative system was rationalized into eight<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>three territorial departments, each with a new name. As revolutionary France prepared for war against its threatened and threatening neighbors, it created the world’s largest army, with some 800,000 men, and all adult males were required to serve. Led by officers from the middle and even lower classes, this was an army of citizens representing the nation.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p035i"><p>Effects of the Atlantic Revolutions on women’s rights are “must know” information for the AP<sup>®</sup> exam.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p046"><p>In terms of gender roles, the French Revolution did not create a new society, but it did raise the question of female political equality far more explicitly than the American Revolution had done. Partly this was because French women were active in the major events of the revolution. In July 1789, they took part in the famous storming of the Bastille, a large fortress, prison, and armory that had come to symbolize the oppressive old regime. In October of that year, some 7,000 Parisian women, desperate about the shortage of bread, marched on the palace at Versailles, stormed through the royal apartments searching for the despised Queen Marie Antoinette, and forced the royal family to return with them to Paris.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p047"><p>Backed by a few male supporters, women also made serious political demands. They signed petitions detailing their complaints: lack of education, male competition in female trades, the prevalence of prostitution, the rapidly rising price of bread and soap. One petition, reflecting the intersection of class and gender, referred to women as the “Third Estate of the Third Estate.” Another demanded the right to bear arms in defense of the revolution. Over sixty women’s clubs were established throughout the country. A small group called the Cercle Social (Social Circle) campaigned for women’s rights, noting that “the laws favor men at the expense of women, because everywhere power is in your hands.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-002_8">8</span> The French playwright and journalist Olympe de Gouges appropriated the language of the Declaration of Rights to insist that “woman is born free and lives equal to man in her rights.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p048"><p>But the assertion of French women in the early years of the revolution seemed wildly inappropriate and threatening to most men, uniting conservatives and revolutionaries alike in defense of male privileges. And so in late 1793, the country’s all-male legislative body voted to ban all women’s clubs. “Women are ill-suited for elevated thoughts and serious meditation,” declared one of the male representatives. “A woman should not leave her family to meddle in affairs of government.” Here was a conception of gender that defined masculinity in terms of exercising political power. Women who aspired to do so were, in the words of one revolutionary orator, “denatured <em>viragos</em>” (domineering women), in short, not really women at all.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-002_9">9</span> Thus French revolutionaries were distinctly unwilling to offer any political rights to women, even though they had eliminated class restrictions, at least in theory; granted religious freedom to Jews and Protestants; and abolished slavery. Nonetheless, according to a leading historian, “the French Revolution, more than any other event of its time, opened up the question of women’s rights for consideration” and thus laid the foundations for modern feminism.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch16-sec2-002_10">10</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p049"><p>If not in terms of gender, the immediate impact of the revolution was felt in many other ways. Streets got new names; monuments to the royal family were destroyed; titles vanished; people referred to one another as “citizen so-and-so.” Real politics in the public sphere emerged for the first time as many people joined political clubs, took part in marches and demonstrations, served on local committees, and ran for public office. Ordinary men and women, who had identified primarily with their local communities, now began to think of themselves as belonging to a nation. The state replaced the Catholic Church as the place for registering births, marriages, and deaths, and revolutionary festivals substituted for church holidays.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p050"><p>More radical revolutionary leaders deliberately sought to convey a sense of new beginnings and endless possibilities. At a Festival of Unity held in 1793 to mark the first anniversary of the end of monarchy, participants burned the crowns and scepters of the royal family in a huge bonfire while releasing a cloud of 3,000 white doves. The Cathedral of Notre Dame was temporarily turned into the Temple of Reason, while the “Hymn to Liberty” combined traditional church music with the explicit message of the Enlightenment:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="vrs-first" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p051"><p>Oh Liberty, sacred Liberty</p></div>

<div data-block_type="vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p060"><p>These are the sacred tenets</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p062"><p>Elsewhere too the French Revolution evoked images of starting over. Witnessing that revolution in 1790, the young William Wordsworth, later a famous British Romantic poet, imagined “human nature seeming born again.” “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive,” he wrote. “But to be young was very heaven.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p063"><p>The French Revolution also differed from the American Revolution in the way its influence spread. At least until the United States became a world power at the end of the nineteenth century, what inspired others was primarily the example of its revolution and its constitution. French influence, by contrast, spread through conquest, largely under the leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte (r. 1799–1814). A highly successful general who seized power in 1799, Napoleon is often credited with taming the revolution in the face of growing disenchantment with its more radical features and with the social conflicts it generated. He preserved many of its more moderate elements, such as civil equality, a secular law code, religious freedom, and promotion by merit, while reconciling with the Catholic Church and suppressing the revolution’s more democratic elements in a military dictatorship. In short, Napoleon kept the revolution’s emphasis on social equality for men but dispensed with liberty.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch16-p064"><p>Like many of the revolution’s ardent supporters, Napoleon was intent on spreading its benefits far and wide. In a series of brilliant military campaigns, his forces subdued most of Europe, thus creating the continent’s largest empire since the days of the Romans (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch16/STR_02272_16_M02.html" data-target="_pop">Map 16.2</span>). Within that empire, Napoleon imposed such revolutionary practices as ending feudalism, proclaiming equality of rights, insisting on religious toleration, codifying the laws, and rationalizing government administration. In many places, these reforms were welcomed, and seeds of further change were planted. But French domination was also resented and resisted, stimulating national consciousness throughout Europe. That too was a seed that bore fruit in the century that followed. More immediately, national resistance, particularly from Russia and Britain, brought down Napoleon and his amazing empire by 1815 and marked an end to the era of the French Revolution, though not to the potency of its ideas.</p></div>
