</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0182"><p>Winners may write history, but they do not make history, at least not alone. Dominant groups everywhere — slave owners, upper classes, men generally, and certainly colonial rulers — have found their actions constrained and their choices limited by the sheer presence of subordinated people and the ability of those people to act. Europeans who sought to make their countries sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>sufficient in cotton by requiring colonized Africans to grow it generally found themselves unable to achieve that goal. Missionaries who tried to impose their own understanding of Christianity in the colonies found their converts often unwilling to accept missionary authority or the cultural framework in which the new religion was presented. In the twentieth century, colonial rulers all across Asia and Africa found that their most highly educated subjects became the leaders of those movements seeking to end colonial rule. Clearly, this was not what they had intended.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0183"><p>In recent decades, historians have been at pains to uncover the ways in which subordinated people — slaves, workers, peasants, women, the colonized — have been able to act in their own interests, even within the most oppressive conditions. This kind of “history from below” found expression in a famous book about American slavery that was subtitled <em>The World the Slaves Made</em>. Historians of women’s lives have sought to show women not only as victims of patriarchy but also as historical actors in their own right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_823"><p>823</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0184"><p>Likewise, colonized people in any number of ways actively shaped the history of the colonial era. On occasion, they resisted and rebelled; in various times and places, they embraced, rejected, and transformed a transplanted Christianity; many eagerly sought Western education but later turned it against the colonizers; women both suffered from and creatively coped with the difficulties of colonial life; and everywhere people created new ways of belonging. None of this diminishes the hardships, the enormous inequalities of power, or the exploitation and oppression of the colonial experience. Rather, it suggests that history is often made through the struggle of unequal groups and that the outcome corresponds to no one’s intentions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0185"><p>Perhaps we might let Karl Marx have the last word on this endlessly fascinating topic: “Men make their own history,” he wrote, “but they do not make it as they please nor under conditions of their own choosing.” In the colonial experience of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, both the colonizers and the colonized “made history,” but neither was able to do so as they pleased.</p></div>
