<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p094"><p>Unlike Korea and Vietnam, the Japanese islands were physically separated from China by 100 miles or more of ocean and were never successfully invaded or conquered by their giant mainland neighbor (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch8/STR_02272_08_M04.html" data-target="_pop">Map 8.4</span>). Thus Japan’s very extensive borrowing from Chinese civilization was wholly voluntary, rather than occurring under conditions of direct military threat or outright occupation. The high point of that borrowing took place during the seventh to the ninth centuries <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, as the first more or less unified Japanese state began to emerge from dozens of small cla<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>based aristocratic chiefdoms. That state found much that was useful in Tang dynasty China and set out, deliberately and systematically, to transform Japan into a centralized bureaucratic state on the Chinese model.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p095"><p>The initial leader of this effort was Shotoku Taishi (572–622), a prominent aristocrat from one of the major clans. He launched a series of larg<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>scale missions to China, which took hundreds of Japanese monks, scholars, artists, and students to the mainland, and when they returned, they put into practice what they had learned. In 604 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> Shotoku issued the Seventeen Article Constitution, proclaiming the Japanese ruler as a Chines<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>style emperor and encouraging both Buddhism and Confucianism. In good Confucian fashion, that document emphasized the moral quality of rulers as a foundation for social harmony. In the decades that followed, Japanese authorities adopted Chines<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>style court rituals and a system of court rankings for officials as well as the Chinese calendar. Subsequently, they likewise established Chines<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based taxation systems, law codes, government ministries, and provincial administration, at least on paper. Two capital cities, first Nara and then Heia<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>kyo (Kyoto), arose, both modeled on the Chinese capital of Chang’an.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p096"><p>Chinese culture, no less than its political practices, also found favor in Japan. Various schools of Chinese Buddhism took root, first among the educated and literate classes and later more broadly in Japanese society, deeply affecting much of Japanese life. Art, architecture, education, medicine, views of the afterlife, attitudes toward suffering and the impermanence of life — all of this and more reflected the influence of Buddhist culture in Japan. The Chinese writing system — and with it an interest in historical writing, calligraphy, and poetry — likewise proved attractive among the elite.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p097"><p>The absence of any compelling threat from China made it possible for the Japanese to be selective in their borrowing. By the tenth century, deliberate efforts to absorb additional elements of Chinese culture diminished, and formal tribute missions to China stopped, although private traders and Buddhist monks continued to make the difficult journey to the mainland. Over many centuries, the Japanese combined what they had assimilated from China with elements of their own tradition into a distinctive Japanese civilization, which differed from Chinese culture in many ways.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p098"><p>In the political realm, for example, the Japanese never succeeded in creating an effective centralized and bureaucratic state to match that of China. Although the court and the emperor retained an important ceremonial and cultural role, their real political authority over the country gradually diminished in favor of competing aristocratic families, both at court and in the provinces. A Chinese-style university trained officials, but rather than serving as a mechanism for recruiting talented commoners into the political elite, it enrolled students who were largely the sons of court aristocrats.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p099"><p>As political power became increasingly decentralized, local authorities developed their own military forces, the famous <em>samurai</em> warrior class of Japanese society. Bearing their exquisite curved swords, the samurai developed a distinctive set of values featuring bravery, loyalty, endurance, honor, great skill in martial arts, and a preference for death over surrender. This was <em>bushido</em> (boo-shee-doh), the way of the warrior. Japan’s celebration of the samurai and of military virtues contrasted sharply with China’s emphasis on intellectual achievements and political office holding, which were accorded higher prestige than bearing arms. “The educated men of the land,” wrote a Chinese minister in the eleventh century, “regard the carrying of arms as a disgrace.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-008_18">18</span> The Japanese, clearly, did not agree.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0102"><p>Religiously as well, Japan remained distinctive. Although Buddhism in many forms took hold in the country, it never completely replaced the native beliefs and practices, which focused attention on numerous <em>kami</em>, sacred spirits associated with human ancestors and various natural phenomena. Much later referred to as Shinto, this tradition provided legitimacy to the imperial family, based on claims of descent from the sun goddess. Because veneration of the kami lacked an elaborate philosophy or ritual, it conflicted very little with Buddhism. In fact, numerous kami were assimilated into Japanese Buddhism as local expressions of Buddhist deities or principles.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0103"><p>Japanese literary and artistic culture likewise evolved in distinctive ways, despite much borrowing from China. As in Korea and Vietnam, there emerged a unique writing system that combined Chinese characters with a series of phonetic symbols. A highly stylized Japanese poetic form, known as tanka, developed early and has remained a favored means of expression ever since. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch8_16.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Izumi Shikibu for the life of Japan’s best-known female tanka poet</span>.) Particularly during the Heian period of Japanese history (794–1192), a highly refined aesthetic culture found expression at the imperial court, even as the court’s real political authority melted away. Court aristocrats and their ladies lived in splendor, composed poems, arranged flowers, and conducted their love affairs. “What counted,” wrote one scholar, “was the proper costume, the right ceremonial act, the successful turn of phrase in a poem, and the appropriate expression of refined taste.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-008_19">19</span> Much of our knowledge of this courtly culture comes from the work of women writers, who composed their diaries and novels in the vernacular Japanese script, rather than in the classical Chinese used by elite men. <em>The Tale of Genji</em>, a Japanese novel written by the woman author Murasaki Shikibu around 1000, provides an intimate picture of the intrigues and romances of court life.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0113"><p>At this level of society, Japan’s women, unlike those in Korea, largely escaped the more oppressive features of Chinese Confucian culture, such as the prohibition of remarriage for widows, seclusion within the home, and foot binding. Perhaps this is because the most powerful Chinese influence on Japan occurred during the Tang dynasty, when Chinese elite women enjoyed considerable freedom. Japanese women continued to inherit property; Japanese married couples often lived apart or with the wife’s family; and marriages were made and broken easily. None of this corresponded to Confucian values. When Japanese women did begin to lose status in the twelfth century and later, it had less to do with Confucian pressures than with the rise of a warrior culture. As the personal relationships of samurai warriors to their lords replaced marriage alliances as a political strategy, the influence of women in political life was reduced, but this was an internal Japanese phenomenon, not a reflection of Chinese influence.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0114"><p>Japan’s ability to borrow extensively from China while developing its own distinctive civilization perhaps provided a model for its encounter with the West in the nineteenth century. Then, as before, Japan borrowed selectively from a foreign culture without losing either its political independence or its cultural uniqueness.</p></div>
