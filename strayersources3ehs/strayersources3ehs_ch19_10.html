</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p062"><p>In 1750, the Ottoman Empire was still the central political fixture of a widespread Islamic world. From its Turkish heartland in Anatolia, it ruled over much of the Arab world, from which Islam had come. It protected pilgrims on their way to Mecca, governed Egypt and coastal North Africa, and incorporated millions of Christians in the Balkans. Its ruler, the sultan, claimed the role of caliph, successor to the Prophet Muhammad, and was widely viewed as the leader, defender, and primary representative of the Islamic world. But by the middle, and certainly by the end, of the nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was no longer able to deal with Europe from a position of equality, let alone superiority. Among the Great Powers of the West, it was now known as “the sick man of Europe.” Within the Muslim world, the Ottoman Empire, once viewed as “the strong sword of Islam,” was unable to prevent region after region — India, Indonesia, West Africa, Central Asia — from falling under the control of Christian powers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p063"><p>The Ottoman Empire’s own domains shrank considerably at the hands of Russian, British, Austrian, and French aggression (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch19/STR_02272_19_M02.html" data-target="_pop">Map 19.2</span>). In 1798, Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt, which had long been a province of the Ottoman Empire, was a particularly stunning blow.

And the French trod in the Mosque of al-Azhar with their shoes, carrying swords and rifles…. They plundered whatever they found in the mosque…. They treated the books and Quranic volumes as trash…. Furthermore, they soiled the mosque, blowing their spit in it, pissing and defecating in it.

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p068"><p>What lay behind the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p065"><p>When the French left, a virtually independent Egypt pursued a modernizing and empire-building program of its own during the early and mid-nineteenth century and on one occasion came close to toppling the Ottoman Empire itself.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p066"><p>Beyond territorial losses to stronger European powers, other parts of the empire, such as Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania, achieved independence based on their own surging nationalism and support from the British or the Russians. The continued independence of the core region of the Ottoman Empire owed much to the inability of Europe’s Great Powers to agree on how to divide it up among themselves.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_846"><p>846</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p069"><p>Behind the contraction of the Ottoman Empire lay other problems. As in China, the central Ottoman state had weakened, particularly in its ability to raise necessary revenue, as provincial authorities and local warlords gained greater power. Moreover, the Janissaries, once the effective and innovative elite infantry units of Ottoman military forces, lost their military edge, becoming a highly conservative force within the empire. The technological and military gap with the West was clearly growing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p070"><p>Economically, the earlier centrality of the Ottoman and Arab lands in Afro-Eurasian commerce diminished as Europeans achieved direct oceanic access to the treasures of Asia. Competition from cheap European manufactured goods hit Ottoman artisans hard and led to urban riots protesting foreign imports. Furthermore, a series of agreements, known as capitulations, between European countries and the Ottoman Empire granted Westerners various exemptions from Ottoman law and taxation. Like the unequal treaties with China, these agreements facilitated European penetration of the Ottoman economy and became widely resented. Such measures eroded Ottoman sovereignty and reflected the changing position of that empire relative to Europe. So too did the growing indebtedness of the Ottoman Empire, which came to rely on foreign loans to finance its efforts at economic development. By 1881, its inability to pay the interest on those debts led to foreign control of much of its revenue-generating system, while a similar situation in Egypt led to its outright occupation by the British. Like China, the Ottoman Empire had fallen into a position of considerable dependency on Europe.</p></div>
