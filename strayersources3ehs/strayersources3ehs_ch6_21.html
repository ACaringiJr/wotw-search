<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0135"><p>Even more widespread — in the eastern woodlands of the United States, Central America, the Amazon basin, the Caribbean islands — were societies sustained by villag<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based agriculture. Owing to environmental or technological limitations, it was a less intensive and productive agriculture than in Mesoamerica or the Andes and supported usually much smaller populations (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch6/STR_02272_06_M04.html" data-target="_pop">Map 6.4</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch12/STR_02272_12_M05.html" data-target="_pop">Map 12.5</span>). These peoples too made their own histories, changing in response to their unique environments, their interactions with outsiders, and their own visions of the world. The Anasazi of the southwestern United States, now called the Ancestral Pueblo, and the moun<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>building cultures of the eastern woodlands provide two illustrations from North America.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0138"><p>In what ways were the histories of the Ancestral Pueblo and the Mound Builders similar to each other, and how did they differ?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0136"><p>The southwestern region of North America, an arid land cut by mountain ranges and large basins, first acquired maize from its place of origin in Mesoamerica during the second millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, but it took roughly 2,000 years for that crop, later supplemented by beans and squash, to become the basis of a settled agricultural way of living. In a desert region, farming was risky, and maize had to be gradually adapted to the local environment. Not until around 600 to 800 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> did permanent village life take hold widely. People then lived in pit houses with floors sunk several feet below ground level. Some settlements had only a few such homes, whereas others contained twent<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>five or more. By 900 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, many of these villages also included kivas, much larger pit structures used for ceremonial purposes, which symbolized the widespread belief that humankind emerged into this world from another world below. Individual settlements were linked to one another in local trading networks and sometimes in wider webs of exchange that brought them buffalo hides, copper, turquoise, seashells, macaw feathers, and coiled baskets from quite distant locations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_256"><p>256</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0139"><p>These processes of change — growing dependence on agriculture, increasing population, more intensive patterns of exchange — gave rise to larger settlements and adjacent aboveground structures known as pueblos. The most spectacular of these took shape in Chaco canyon in what is now northwestern New Mexico. There, between 860 and 1130 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, five major pueblos emerged. This Chaco Phenomenon encompassed 25,000 square miles and linked some seventy outlying settlements to the main centers. The population was not large, perhaps as few as 5,000 people, although experts continue to debate the issue. The largest of these towns, or “great houses,” Pueblo Bonito, stood five stories high and contained more than 600 rooms and many kivas. Hundreds of miles of roads, up to forty feet wide, radiated out from Chaco, likewise prompting much debate among scholars. Without wheeled carts or large domesticated animals, such an elaborate road system seems unnecessary for ordinary trade or travel. Did the roads represent, as some scholars speculate, a “sacred landscape which gave order to the world,” joining its outlying communities to a “Middle Place,” an entrance perhaps to the underworld?<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-010_15">15</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0140"><p>Among the Chaco elite were highly skilled astronomers who constructed an observatory of three large rock slabs situated so as to throw a beam of light across a spiral rock carving behind it at the summer solstice. By the eleventh century, Chaco also had become a dominant center for the production of turquoise ornaments, which became a major item of regional commerce, extending as far south as Mesoamerica. Not all was sweetness and light, however. Warfare, internal conflict, and occasional cannibalism (a matter of much controversy among scholars) apparently increased in frequency as an extended period of drought in the half century following 1130 brought this flourishing culture to a rather abrupt end. By 1200, the great houses had been abandoned and their inhabitants scattered in small communities that later became the Pueblo peoples of more recent times.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0141"><p>Unlike the Chaco region in the southwest, the eastern woodlands of North America and especially the Mississippi River valley hosted an independent Agricultural Revolution. By 2000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, many of its peoples had domesticated local plant species, including sumpweed, goosefoot, some gourds and squashes, and a form of artichoke. Sunflowers, originally domesticated in Mesoamerica, also found a place in diets of eastern woodland peoples. These few plants, however, were not sufficient to support a fully settled agricultural village life; rather, they supplemented diets derived from gathering and hunting without fundamentally changing that ancient way of life. Such peoples created societies distinguished by arrays of large earthen mounds, found all over the United States east of the Mississippi, prompting archeologists to dub them the Mound Builders. The earliest of these mounds date to around 2000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, but the most elaborate and widespread took shape between 200 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> and 400 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, commonly called the Hopewell culture, after an archeological site in Ohio.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_257"><p>257</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0142"><p>Several features of the Hopewell culture have intrigued archeologists. Particularly significant are the striking burial mounds and geometric earthworks, sometimes covering areas equivalent to several city blocks, and the wide variety of artifacts found within them — smoking pipes, human figurines, mica mirrors, flint blades, fabrics, and jewelry of all kinds. The mounds themselves were no doubt the focus of elaborate burial rituals, but some of them were aligned with the moon with such precision as to mark lunar eclipses. Developed most elaborately in the Ohio River valley, Hopewell-style earthworks, artifacts, and ceremonial pottery have also been found throughout the eastern woodlands region of North America. Hopewell centers in Ohio contained mica from the Appalachian Mountains, volcanic glass from Yellowstone, conch shells and a few sharks’ teeth from the Gulf of Mexico, and copper from the Great Lakes. All of this suggests a large “Hopewell Interaction Sphere,” linking this entire region in a loose network of exchange, as well as a measure of cultural borrowing of religious ideas and practices.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-010_16">16</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0143"><p>The next and most spectacular phase in the history of these mound-building peoples took shape as corn-based agriculture, derived ultimately but indirectly from Mexico, gained ground in the Mississippi valley after 800 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, allowing larger populations and more complex societies to emerge. The dominant center was Cahokia, near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, which flourished from about 900 to 1250 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> Its central mound, a terraced pyramid of four levels, measured 1,000 feet long by 700 feet wide, rose more than 100 feet above the ground, and occupied fifteen acres. It was the largest structure north of Mexico, the focal point of a community numbering 10,000 or more people, and the center of a widespread trading network (see an <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch1/STR_02272_01_P08.html" data-target="_pop">artist’s reconstruction of Cahokia</span>).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0144"><p>Evidence from burials and from later Spanish observers suggests that Cahokia and other centers of this Mississippi culture were stratified societies with a clear elite and with rulers able to mobilize the labor required to build such enormous structures. One hig<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>status male was buried on a platform of 20,000 shell beads, accompanied by 800 arrowheads, sheets of copper and mica, and a number of sacrificed men and women nearby.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-010_17">17</span> Well after Cahokia had declined and was abandoned, sixteent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century Spanish and French explorers encountered another such chiefdom among the Natchez people, located in southwestern Mississippi. Paramount chiefs, known as Great Suns, dressed in kne<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>length fur coats and lived luxuriously in deerski<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>covered homes. An elite class of “principal men” or “honored peoples” clearly occupied a different status from commoners, sometimes referred to as “stinkards.” These sharp class distinctions were blunted by the requirement that uppe<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>class people, including the Great Suns, had to marry “stinkards.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0145"><p>The military capacity of these Mississippi chiefdoms greatly impressed European observers, as this Spanish account indicates:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_258"><p>258</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0146"><p>The next day the cacique [paramount chief] arrived with 200 canoes filled with men, having weapons, … the warriors standing erect from bow to stern, holding bows and arrows…. [F]rom under the canopy where the chief man was, the course was directed and orders issued to the rest…. [W]hat with the awnings, the plumes, the shields, the pennons, and the number of people in the fleet, it appeared like a famous armada of galleys.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-010_18">18</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p035t"><p>Know that the temple complex at Cahokia is an example of monumental architecture.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0147"><p>Here then, in the eastern woodlands of North America, were peoples who independently generated a modest Agricultural Revolution, assimilated corn and beans from distant sources, developed increasingly complex chiefdoms, and created monumental structures, new technologies, and artistic traditions. Beyond the separate societies that emerged within this large area, scholars have noticed some similarities in artifacts, symbols, ceremonies, mythologies, and artistic styles, many of which seem related to marking the status of elites. A horned serpent, sometimes depicted with wings, and various animal-god representations were widely shared symbols, though the meaning of these symbols no doubt changed as they entered new cultural environments. Dubbed the Southeast Ceremonial Complex, the loose networks of connection that generated these similarities grew outward from Cahokia for several centuries after 1200 or so, continuing earlier patterns of interaction associated with the Hopewell cultural region. While no linguistic, cultural, or political unity emerged from these relationships, they testify to a measure of exchange, borrowing, and cultural adaptation across an enormous region of North America.</p></div>
