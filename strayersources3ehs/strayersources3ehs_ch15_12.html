</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p085"><p>Neither China nor India experienced cultural or religious change as dramatic as that of the Reformation in Europe, nor did Confucian or Hindu cultures during the early modern era spread widely, as did Christianity and Islam. Nonetheless, neither of these traditions remained static. As in Christian Europe, challenges to established orthodoxies in China and India emerged as commercial and urban life, as well as political change, fostered new thinking.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p087"><p>What kinds of cultural changes occurred in China and India during the early modern era?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p088"><p>China during the Ming and Qing dynasties continued to operate broadly within a Confucian framework, enriched now by the insights of Buddhism and Daoism to generate a system of thought called Neo-Confucianism. Chinese Ming dynasty rulers, in their aversion to the despised Mongols, embraced and actively supported this native Confucian tradition, whereas the foreign Manchu or Qing rulers did so to woo Chinese intellectuals to support the new dynasty. Within this context, a considerable amount of controversy, debate, and new thinking emerged during the early modern era.</p></div>

<h3 data-type="title" data-for_type="box" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-ch15-bx1-001l">AP® EXAM TIP</h3>
<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p035l"><p>Pay attention to factors that led to the rise of Neo-Confucianism. List the ways in which it differed from traditional Confucianism.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p089"><p>During late Ming times, for example, the influential thinker Wang Yangming (1472–1529) argued that “intuitive moral knowledge exists in people … even robbers know that they should not rob.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-006_11">11</span> Thus anyone could achieve a virtuous life by introspection and contemplation, without the extended education, study of classical texts, and constant striving for improvement that traditional Confucianism prescribed for an elite class of “gentlemen.” Such ideas figured prominently among Confucian scholars of the sixteenth century, although critics later contended that such thinking promoted an excessive individualism. They also argued that Wang Yangming’s ideas had undermined the Ming dynasty and contributed to China’s conquest by the foreign Manchus. Some Chinese Buddhists as well sought to make their religion more accessible to ordinary people, by suggesting that laypeople at home could undertake practices similar to those performed by monks in monasteries. Withdrawal from the world was not necessary for enlightenment. This kind of moral or religious individualism bore some similarity to the thinking of Martin Luther, who argued that individuals could seek salvation by “faith alone,” without the assistance of a priestly hierarchy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p090"><p>Another new direction in Chinese elite culture took shape in a movement known as <em>kaozheng</em>, or “research based on evidence.” Intended to “seek truth from facts,” kaozheng was critical of the unfounded speculation of conventional Confucian philosophy and instead emphasized the importance of verification, precision, accuracy, and rigorous analysis in all fields of inquiry. During the late Ming years, this emphasis generated works dealing with agriculture, medicine, pharmacology, botany, craft techniques, and more. In the Qing era, kaozheng was associated with the recovery and critical analysis of ancient historical documents, which sometimes led to sharp criticism of Neo-Confucian orthodoxy. It was a genuinely scientific approach to knowledge, but it was applied more to the study of the past than to the natural world of astronomy, physics, or anatomy, which was the focus in the West.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p091"><p>While such matters occupied the intellectual elite of China, in the cities a lively popular culture emerged among the less educated. For city-dwellers, plays, paintings, short stories, and especially novels provided diversion and entertainment that were a step up from what could be found in teahouses and wineshops. Numerous “how-to” painting manuals allowed a larger public to participate in this favorite Chinese art form. Even though Confucian scholars disdained popular fiction, a vigorous printing industry responded to the growing demand for exciting novels. The most famous was Cao Xueqin’s mid-eighteenth-century novel <em>The Dream of the Red Chamber</em>, a huge book that contained 120 chapters and some 400 characters, most of them women. It explored the social life of an eighteenth-century elite family with connections to the Chinese court.</p></div>
