<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p035t"><p>Know the effects of the spread of Greek culture throughout Afro-Eurasia over time.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0142"><p>The rationalism of the Greek tradition was clearly not the whole of Greek culture. The gods of Mount Olympus continued to be a reality for many people, and the ecstatic songs and dances that celebrated Dionysus, the god of wine, were anything but rational and reflective. The death of Socrates at the hands of an Athenian jury showed that philosophy could be a threat as well as an engaging pastime. Nonetheless, Greek rationalism, together with Greek art, literature, and theater, persisted long after the glory days of Athens were over. Alexander’s empire and that of the Romans facilitated the spread of Greek culture within the Mediterranean basin and beyond, and not a few leading Roman figures sent their children to be educated in Athens at the Academy, which Plato had founded. An emerging Christian theology was expressed in terms of Greek philosophical concepts, especially those of Plato. Even after the western Roman Empire collapsed, classical Greek texts were preserved in the eastern half, known as the Byzantine Empire or Byzantium.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0143"><p>In the West, however, direct access to Greek texts was far more difficult in the chaotic conditions of post-Roman Europe, and for centuries Greek scholarship was neglected in favor of distinctly Christian writers. Much of that legacy was subsequently rediscovered after the twelfth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> as European scholars gained access to classical Greek texts. From that point on, the Greek legacy has been viewed as a central element of an emerging “Western” civilization. It played a role in formulating an updated Christian theology, in fostering Europe’s Scientific Revolution, and in providing a point of departure for much of European philosophy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0144"><p>Long before this European rediscovery, the Greek legacy had also entered the Islamic world. Systematic translations of Greek works of science and philosophy into Arabic, together with Indian and Persian learning, stimulated Muslim thinkers and scientists, especially in the fields of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, geography, and chemistry. It was in fact largely from Arabic translations of Greek writers that Europeans became reacquainted with the legacy of classical Greece, especially during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Despite the many centuries that have passed since the flourishing of ancient Greek culture, that tradition has remained, especially in the West, an inspiration for those who celebrate the powers of the human mind to probe the mysteries of the universe and to explore the equally challenging domain of human life.</p></div>
