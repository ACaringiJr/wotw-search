</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p075"><p>The early modern era likewise witnessed the continuation of the “long march of Islam” across the Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Asian world. In su<span data-block_type="nobr">b-</span><wbr/>Saharan Africa, in the eastern and western wings of India, and in Central and Southeast Asia, the expansion of the Islamic frontier, a process already a thousand years in the making, extended farther still. Conversion to Islam generally did not mean a sudden abandonment of old religious practices in favor of the new. Rather, it was more often a matter of “assimilating Islamic rituals, cosmologies, and literatures into … local religious systems.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-005_10">10</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p078"><p>Continued Islamization was not usually the product of conquering armies and expanding empires. It depended instead on wandering Muslim holy men or Sufis, Islamic scholars, and itinerant traders, none of whom posed a threat to local rulers. In fact, such people often were useful to those rulers and their village communities. They offered literacy in Arabic, established informal schools, provided protective charms containing passages from the Quran, served as advisers to local authorities and healers to the sick, often intermarried with local people, and generally did not insist that new converts give up their older practices. What they offered, in short, was connection to the wider, prestigious, prosperous world of Islam. Islamization extended modestly even to the Americas, where enslaved African Muslims practiced their faith in North America, particularly in Brazil, where Muslims led a number of slave revolts in the early nineteenth century.

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p035j"><p>You need to know ways that Islam changed as it spread into Southeast Asia and also ways that it stayed the same.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p079"><p>The islands of Southeast Asia illustrate the diversity of belief and practice that accompanied the spread of Islam in the early modern era. During the seventeenth century in Aceh, a Muslim sultanate on the northern tip of Sumatra, authorities sought to enforce the dietary codes and almsgiving practices of Islamic law. After four successive women ruled the area in the late seventeenth century, women were forbidden from exercising political power. On Muslim Java, however, numerous women served in royal courts, and women throughout Indonesia continued their longtime role as buyers and sellers in local markets. Among ordinary Javanese, traditional animistic practices of spirit worship coexisted easily with a tolerant and accommodating Islam, while merchants often embraced a more orthodox version of the religion in line with Middle Eastern traditions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p080"><p>To such orthodox Muslims, religious syncretism, which accompanied Islamization almost everywhere, became increasingly offensive, even heretical. Such sentiments played an important role in movements of religious renewal and reform that emerged throughout the vast Islamic world of the eighteenth century. The leaders of such movements sharply criticized those practices that departed from earlier patterns established by Muhammad and from the authority of the Quran. For example, in India, which was governed by the Muslim Mughal Empire, religious resistance to official policies that accommodated Hindus found concrete expression during the reign of the emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch13_19.html" data-target="_pop">“Muslims and Hindus in the Mughal Empire”</span> in Chapter 13). A series of religious wars in West Africa during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries took aim at corrupt Islamic practices and the rulers, Muslim and no<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>Muslim alike, who permitted them. In Southeast and Central Asia, tension grew between practitioners of localized and blended versions of Islam and those who sought to purify such practices in the name of a more authentic and universal faith.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p081"><p>The most wel<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>known and widely visible of these Islamic renewal movements took place during the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>eighteenth century in Arabia itself, where the religion had been born more than 1,000 years earlier. This movement originated in the teachings of the Islamic scholar Muhammad Ibn Abd a<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>Wahhab (1703–1792). The growing difficulties of the Islamic world, such as the weakening of the Ottoman Empire, were directly related, he argued, to deviations from the pure faith of early Islam. A<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>Wahhab was particularly upset by common religious practices in central Arabia that seemed to him idolatry — the widespread veneration of Sufi saints and their tombs, the adoration of natural sites, and even the respect paid to Muhammad’s tomb at Medina. All of this was a dilution of the absolute monotheism of authentic Islam.</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p082"><p>The Wahhabi movement took a new turn in the 1740s when it received the political backing of Muhammad Ibn Saud, a local ruler who found al-Wahhab’s ideas compelling. With Ibn Saud’s support, the religious movement became an expansive state in central Arabia. Within that state, offending tombs were razed; “idols” were eliminated; books on logic were destroyed; the use of tobacco, hashish, and musical instruments was forbidden; and certain taxes not authorized by religious teaching were abolished.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p083"><p>Al-Wahhab’s ideas about the role of women have attracted considerable attention in light of the highly restrictive practices of Wahhabi Islam in contemporary Saudi Arabia. He did on one occasion reluctantly authorize the stoning of a woman who persisted in an adulterous sexual relationship after numerous warnings, but more generally he emphasized the rights of women within a patriarchal Islamic framework. These included the right to consent to and stipulate conditions for a marriage, to control her dowry, to divorce, and to engage in commerce. Such rights, long embedded in Islamic law, had apparently been forgotten or ignored in eighteenth-century Arabia. Furthermore, he did not insist on head-to-toe covering of women in public and allowed for the mixing of unrelated men and women for business or medical purposes.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p084"><p>By the early nineteenth century, this new reformist state encompassed much of central Arabia, with Mecca itself coming under Wahhabi control in 1803 (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch15/STR_02272_15_M03.html" data-target="_pop">Map 15.3</span>). Although an Egyptian army broke the power of the Wahhabis in 1818, the movement’s influence continued to spread across the Islamic world. Together with the ongoing expansion of the religion, these movements of reform and renewal signaled the continuing cultural vitality of the “abode of Islam,” even as the European presence on the world stage assumed larger dimensions. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such movements persisted and became associated with resistance to the political, military, and cultural intrusion of the European West into the affairs of the Islamic world.</p></div>
