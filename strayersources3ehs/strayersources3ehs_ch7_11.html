</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p068"><p>The world of Indian Ocean commerce was long in the making, dating back to the time of the First Civilizations. Seaborne trade via the Persian Gulf between ancient Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley civilization is reflected in archeological finds in both places. Perhaps the stil<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>undeciphered Indian writing system was stimulated by Sumerian cuneiform. The ancient Egyptians, and later the Phoenicians, likewise traded down the Red Sea, exchanging their manufactured goods for gold, ivory, frankincense, and slaves from the coasts of Ethiopia, Somalia, and southern Arabia. These ventures mostly hugged the coast and took place over short distances. Malay sailors, however, were an exception to this rule. Speaking Austronesian languages, they jumped off from the islands of presen<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>day Indonesia during the first millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> and made their way in doubl<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>outrigger canoes across thousands of miles of open ocean to the East African island of Madagascar. There they introduced their language and their crops — bananas, coconuts, and taro — which soon spread to the mainland, where they greatly enriched the diets of African peoples. Also finding its way to the continent was a Malay<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Polynesian xylophone, which is still played in parts of Africa today. A casualty of this migration, coupled with the later arrival of Bant<span data-block_type="nobr">u-</span><wbr/>speaking Africans, was the extinction of the “elephant bird,” a huge flightless bird weighing up to 600 pounds and found only in Madagascar.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p069"><p>The tempo of Indian Ocean commerce picked up in the era of secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations during the early centuries of the Common Era, as mariners learned how to ride the monsoons. Various technological innovations also facilitated Indian Ocean trade — improvements in sails, new kinds of ships called junks with sternpost rudders and keels for greater stability, new means of calculating latitude such as the astrolabe, and evolving versions of the magnetic needle or compass. Around the time of Christ, the Greek geographer Strabo reported that “great fleets [from the Roman Empire] are sent as far as India, whence the most valuable cargoes are brought back to Egypt and thence exported again to other places.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch07-sec2-005_9">9</span> Merchants from the Roman world, mostly Greeks, Syrians, and Jews, established settlements in southern India and along the East African coast. The introduction of Christianity into both Axum and Kerala (in southern India) testifies to the lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>term cultural impact of that trade. In the eastern Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, Chinese and Southeast Asian merchants likewise generated a growing commerce, and by 100 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> Chinese traders had reached India.</p></div>

One was the economic and political revival of China, some four centuries after the collapse of the Han dynasty (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch8_2.html">Chapter 8</span>). Especially during the Tang and Song dynasties (618–1279), China reestablished an effective and unified state, which actively encouraged maritime trade. Furthermore, the impressive growth of the Chinese economy sent Chinese products pouring into the circuits of Indian Ocean commerce, while providing a vast and attractive market for Indian and Southeast Asian goods. Chinese technological innovations, such as larger ships and the magnetic compass, likewise added to the momentum of commercial growth.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p035p"><p>Participation by Muslim merchants in the Indian Ocean network during the postclassical period (ca. 600 <span data-block_type="smallcaps">C.E</span>.–ca. 1450) is important to know.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p075"><p>A second transformation in the world of Indian Ocean commerce involved the sudden rise of Islam in the seventh century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> and its subsequent spread across much of the Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasian world (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch9_2.html">Chapter 9</span>). Unlike Confucian culture, which was quite suspicious of merchants, Islam was friendly to commercial life; the Prophet Muhammad himself had been a trader. The creation of an Arab Empire, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean through the Mediterranean basin and all the way to India, brought together in a single political system an immense range of economies and cultural traditions and provided a vast arena for the energies of Muslim traders.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p076"><p>Those energies greatly intensified commercial activity in the Indian Ocean basin. Middle Eastern gold and silver flowed into southern India to purchase pepper, pearls, textiles, and gemstones. Muslim merchants and sailors, as well as Jews and Christians living within the Islamic world, established communities of traders from East Africa to the south China coast. Efforts to reclaim wasteland in Mesopotamia to produce sugar and dates for export stimulated a slave trade from East Africa, which landed thousands of Africans in southern Iraq to work on plantations and in salt mines under horrendous conditions. A massive fiftee<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>year revolt (868–883) among these slaves badly disrupted the Islamic Abbasid Empire before that rebellion was brutally crushed.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p077"><p>Beyond these specific outcomes, the expansion of Islam gave rise to an international maritime culture by 1000, shared by individuals living in the widely separated port cities around the Indian Ocean. The immense prestige, power, and prosperity of the Islamic world stimulated widespread conversion, which in turn facilitated commercial transactions. Even those who did not convert to Islam, such as Buddhist rulers in Burma, nonetheless regarded it as commercially useful to assume Muslim names. Thus was created “a maritime Silk Road … a commercial and informational network of unparalleled proportions.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch07-sec2-005_10">10</span> After 1000, the culture of this network was increasingly Islamic.</p></div>
