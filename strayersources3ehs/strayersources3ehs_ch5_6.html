<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p046"><p>Most officials came from wealthy families, and in China wealth meant land. When the Qin dynasty unified China by 210 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, most land was held by smal<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>scale peasant farmers. But by the first century <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, the pressures of population growth, taxation, and indebtedness had generated a class of large landowners as impoverished peasants found it necessary to sell their lands to more prosperous neighbors. This accumulation of land in sizable estates was a persistent theme in Chinese history and one that was frequently, though not very successfully, opposed by state authorities. Landlords of such large estates were often able to avoid paying taxes, thus decreasing state revenues and increasing the tax burden for the remaining peasants. In some cases, they could also mount their own military forces that might challenge the authority of the emperor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_195"><p>195</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p047"><p>One of the most dramatic state efforts to counteract the growing power of large landowners is associated with Wang Mang, a high court official of the Han dynasty who usurped the emperor’s throne in 8 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> and immediately launched a series of startling reforms. A firm believer in Confucian good government, Wang Mang saw his reforms as re-creating a golden age of long ago in which small-scale peasant farmers represented the backbone of Chinese society. Accordingly, he ordered the great private estates to be nationalized and divided up among the landless. Government loans to peasant families, limits on the amount of land a family might own, and an end to private slavery were all part of his reform program, but these measures proved impossible to enforce. Opposition from wealthy landowners, nomadic invasions, poor harvests, floods, and famines led to the collapse of Wang Mang’s reforms and his assassination in 23 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p048"><p>Large landowning families, therefore, remained a central feature of Chinese society, although the fate of individual families rose and fell as the wheel of fortune raised them to great prominence or plunged them into poverty and disgrace. As a class, they benefited both from the wealth that their estates generated and from the power and prestige that accompanied their education and their membership in the official elite. The term “scholar-gentry” reflected their twin sources of privilege. With homes in both urban and rural areas, members of the scholar-gentry class lived luxuriously. Multi-storied houses, the finest of silk clothing, gleaming carriages, private orchestras, high-stakes gambling — all of this was part of the life of China’s scholar-gentry class.</p></div>
