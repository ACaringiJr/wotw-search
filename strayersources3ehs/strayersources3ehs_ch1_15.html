</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p080"><p>The chief feature of the long Paleolithic era — and the first human process to operate on a global scale — was the initial settlement of the earth. Then, beginning around 12,000 years ago, a second global pattern began to unfold — agriculture. The terms “Neolithic (New Stone Age) Revolution” and “Agricultural Revolution” both refer to the deliberate cultivation of particular plants as well as the taming and breeding of particular animals. Thus a whole new way of life gradually replaced the earlier practices of gathering and hunting in most parts of the world. Although it took place over centuries and millennia, the coming of agriculture represented a genuinely revolutionary transformation of human life all across the planet and provided the foundation for almost everything that followed: growing populations, settled villages, anima<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>borne diseases, hors<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>drawn chariot warfare, cities, states, empires, civilizations, writing, literature, and much more.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_27"><p>27</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p081"><p>Among the most revolutionary aspects of the age of agriculture was a new relationship between humankind and other living things, for now men and women were not simply using what they found in nature but actively changing nature as well. They were consciously “directing” the process of evolution. The actions of farmers in the Americas, for example, transformed corn from a plant with a cob of an inch or so to one measuring about six inches by 1500. Later efforts more than doubled that length. Farmers everywhere stamped the landscape with a human imprint in the form of fields with boundaries, terraced hillsides, irrigation ditches, and canals. Animals too were transformed as selective breeding produced sheep that grew more wool, cows that gave more milk, and chickens that laid more eggs than their wild counterparts.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p035f"><p>Pay close attention to the domestication of plants and animals and their effects on societies.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p082"><p>This was “domestication” — the taming, and the changing, of nature for the benefit of humankind — but it created a new kind of mutual dependence. Many domesticated plants and animals could no longer survive in the wild and relied on human action or protection to reproduce successfully. Similarly, farmers and herders became dependent on their domesticated plants and animals, for as their populations grew, those larger numbers could no longer sustain themselves in the older gathering, hunting, and fishing fashion. From an outside point of view, it might well seem that corn and cows had tamed human beings, using people to ensure their own survival and growth as a species, as much as the other way around. In many agricultural communities, however, gathering, hunting, and fishing did not quickly disappear, but long continued to supplement agriculture and animal husbandry as food sources. Even in modern industrial societies, hunting continues as a sport, gathering wild mushrooms and berries persists as an enjoyable pastime, and fishing for both profit and pleasure remains a widespread activity. In such ways, the original human style of living resonates still, even in the twenty-first century.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p083"><p>A further revolutionary aspect of the agricultural age is summed up in the term “intensification.” It means getting more for less, in this case more food and resources — far more — from a much smaller area of land than was possible with a gathering and hunting technology. More food meant more people. Growing populations in turn required an even more intensive exploitation of the environment. And so was launched the continuing human effort to “subdue the earth” and to “have dominion over it,” as the biblical story in Genesis recorded God’s command to Adam and Eve.</p></div>
