</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p012"><p>A large part of the problem lies in the rather different trajectories of various regions of the world during this millennium. It is not easy to identify clearly defined features that encompass all major civilizations or human communities during this period and to distinguish them from what went before. We can, however, point to several distinct patterns during this thir<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave era.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p013"><p>In some areas, for example, wholly new but smaller civilizations arose where none had existed before. Along the East African coast, Swahili civilization emerged in a string of thirty or more cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states, very much engaged in the commercial life of the Indian Ocean basin. The kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, Songhay, and others, stimulated and sustained by lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>distance trade across the Sahara, represented a new West African civilization. In the area now encompassed by Ukraine and western Russia, another new civilization, known as Kievan Rus, likewise took shape with a good deal of cultural borrowing from Mediterranean civilization. East and Southeast Asia also witnessed new centers of civilization. Those in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam were strongly influenced by China, while Srivijaya on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and later the Angkor kingdom centered in presen<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>day Cambodia, drew on the Hindu and Buddhist traditions of India.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_274"><p>274</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p014"><p>All of these represent a continuation of a well-established pattern in world history — the globalization of civilization. Each of the new third-wave civilizations was, of course, culturally unique, but like their predecessors of the first and second waves, they too featured states, cities, specialized economic roles, sharp class and gender inequalities, and other elements of “civilized” life. As newcomers to the growing number of civilizations, all of them borrowed heavily from larger or more established centers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p015"><p>The largest, most expansive, and most widely influential of the new third-wave civilizations was surely that of Islam. It began in Arabia in the seventh century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, projecting the Arab peoples into a prominent role as builders of an enormous empire while offering a new, vigorous, and attractive religion. Viewed as a new civilization defined by its religion, the world of Islam came to encompass many other centers of civilization — Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, the interior of West Africa and the coast of East Africa, Spain, southeastern Europe, and more. Here was a uniquely cosmopolitan or “umbrella” civilization that “came closer than any had ever come to uniting all mankind under its ideals.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-pt03-sec2-001_1">1</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p016"><p>Yet another, and quite different, historical pattern during the third-wave millennium involved those older civilizations that persisted or were reconstructed. The Byzantine Empire, embracing the eastern half of the old Roman Empire, continued the patterns of Mediterranean Christian civilization and persisted until 1453, when it was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. In China, following almost four centuries of fragmentation, the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties (589–1279) restored China’s imperial unity and reasserted its Confucian tradition. Indian civilization retained its ancient patterns of caste and Hinduism amid vast cultural diversity, even as parts of India fell under the control of Muslim rulers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p017"><p>Variations on this theme of continuing or renewing older traditions took shape in the Western Hemisphere, where two centers of civilization — in Mesoamerica and in the Andes — had been long established. In Mesoamerica, the collapse of classical Maya civilization and of the great city-state of Teotihuacán by about 900 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> opened the way for other peoples to give new shape to this ancient civilization. The most well-known of these efforts was associated with the Mexica or Aztec people, who created a powerful and impressive state in the fifteenth century. About the same time, on the western rim of South America, a Quechua-speaking people, now known as the Incas, incorporated various centers of Andean civilization into a huge bureaucratic empire. Both the Aztecs and the Incas gave a new political expression to much older patterns of civilized life.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_275"><p>275</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt03-p018"><p>Yet another pattern took shape in Western Europe following the collapse of the Roman Empire. There, would-be kings and church leaders alike sought to maintain links with the older Greco-Roman-Christian traditions of classical Mediterranean civilization. In the absence of empire, however, new and far more decentralized societies emerged, led now by Germanic peoples and centered in Northern and Western Europe, considerably removed from the older centers of Rome and Athens. It was a hybrid civilization, combining old and new, Greco-Roman and Germanic elements, in a distinctive blending. For five centuries or more, this region was a relative backwater, compared to the more vibrant, prosperous, and powerful civilizations of Byzantium, the Islamic world, and China. During the centuries after 1000 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, however, Western European civilization emerged as a rapidly growing and expansive set of competitive states, willing, like other new civilizations, to borrow extensively from their more developed neighbors.</p></div>
