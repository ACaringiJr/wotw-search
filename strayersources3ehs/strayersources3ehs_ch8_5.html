</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p034"><p>Unlike the fall of the western Roman Empire, where political fragmentation proved to be a permanent condition, China regained its unity under the Sui dynasty (589–618). Its emperors solidified that unity by a vast extension of the country’s canal system, stretching some 1,200 miles in length and described by one scholar as “an engineering feat without parallel in the world of its time.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-001_3">3</span> Those canals linked northern and southern China economically and contributed much to the prosperity that followed. But the ruthlessness of Sui emperors and a futile military campaign to conquer Korea exhausted the state’s resources, alienated many people, and prompted the overthrow of the dynasty.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p036"><p>This dynastic collapse, however, witnessed no prolonged disintegration of the Chinese state. The two dynasties that followed — the Tang (618–907) and the Song (960–1279) — built on the Sui foundations of renewed unity (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch8/STR_02272_08_M01.html" data-target="_pop">Map 8.1</span>). Together they established patterns of Chinese life that endured into the twentieth century, despite a fift<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>year period of disunity between the two dynasties. Culturally, this era has long been regarded as a “golden age” of arts and literature, setting standards of excellence in poetry, landscape painting, and ceramics. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencetheleisurelifeofchinaselites" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence: The Leisure Life of China’s Elites</span>.) Particularly during the Song dynasty, an explosion of scholarship gave rise to Ne<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Confucianism, an effort to revive Confucian thinking while incorporating into it some of the insights of Buddhism and Daoism.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p039"><p>Politically, the Tang and Song dynasties built a state structure that endured for a thousand years. Six major ministries — personnel, finance, rites, army, justice, and public works — were accompanied by the Censorate, an agency that exercised surveillance over the rest of the government, checking on the character and competence of public officials. To staff this bureaucracy, the examination system was revived and made more elaborate, facilitated by the ability to print books for the first time in world history. Efforts to prevent cheating on the exams included searching candidates entering the examination hall and placing numbers rather than names on their papers. Schools and colleges proliferated to prepare candidates for the rigorous exams, which became a central feature of upper-class life. A leading world historian has described Tang dynasty China as “the best ordered state in the world.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-001_4">4</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p040"><p>Selecting officials on the basis of merit represented a challenge to established aristocratic families’ hold on public office. Still, a substantial percentage of official positions went to the sons of the privileged, even if they had not passed the exams. Moreover, because education and the examination system grew far more rapidly than the number of official positions, many who passed lower-level exams could not be accommodated with a bureaucratic appointment. Often, however, they were able to combine landowning and success in the examination system to maintain an immense cultural prestige and prominence in their local areas. Despite the state’s periodic efforts to redistribute land in favor of the peasantry, the great families of large landowners continued to encroach on peasant plots, a recurring pattern in rural China from ancient times to the present.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p041"><p>Underlying these cultural and political achievements was an “economic revolution” that made Song dynasty China “by far the richest, most skilled, and most populous country on earth.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-001_5">5</span> The most obvious sign of China’s prosperity was its rapid growth in population, which jumped from about 50 million or 60 million during the Tang dynasty to 120 million by 1200. Behind this doubling of the population were remarkable achievements in agricultural production, particularly the adoption of a fast-ripening and drought-resistant strain of rice from Vietnam.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p042"><p>Many people found their way to the cities, making China the most urbanized country in the world. Dozens of Chinese cities numbered over 100,000, while the Song dynasty capital of Hangzhou was home to more than a million people. A Chinese observer in 1235 provided a vivid description of that city.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-001_6">6</span> Specialized markets abounded for meat, herbs, vegetables, books, rice, and much more, with troupes of actors performing for the crowds. Restaurants advertised their unique offerings — sweet bean soup, pickled dates, juicy lungs, meat pies, pigs’ feet — and some offered vegetarian fare for religious banquets. Inns of various kinds appealed to different groups. Those that served only wine, a practice known as “hitting the cup,” were regarded as “unfit for polite company.” “Luxuriant inns,” marked by red lanterns, featured prostitutes and “wine chambers equipped with beds.” Specialized agencies managed elaborate dinner parties for the wealthy, complete with a Perfume and Medicine Office to “help sober up the guests.” Schools for musicians offered thirteen different courses. Numerous clubs provided companionship for poets, fishermen, Buddhists, physical fitness enthusiasts, antiques collectors, horse lovers, and many other groups. No wonder the Italian visitor Marco Polo described Hangzhou later in the thirteenth century as “beyond dispute the finest and noblest [city] in the world.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-001_7">7</span> (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource72" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 7.2</span>, for a fuller description of Marco Polo’s impressions of Hangzhou.)</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p052"><p>Industrial production likewise soared. In both large-scale enterprises employing hundreds of workers and in smaller backyard furnaces, China’s iron industry increased its output dramatically. By the eleventh century, it was providing the government with 32,000 suits of armor and 16 million iron arrowheads annually, in addition to supplying metal for coins, tools, construction, and bells in Buddhist monasteries. This industrial growth was fueled almost entirely by coal, which also came to provide most of the energy for heating homes and cooking. This no doubt generated considerable air pollution. Technological innovation in other fields also flourished. Inventions in printing, both woodblock and movable type, generated the world’s first printed books, and by 1000 relatively cheap books on religious, agricultural, mathematical, and medical topics became widely available in China. Its navigational and shipbuilding technologies led the world. The Chinese invention of gunpowder created within a few centuries a revolution in military affairs that had global dimensions. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch8_6.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Gunpowder</span>.) But China’s remarkable industrial revolution stalled as the country was repeatedly invaded and devastated by nomadic peoples from the north, culminating in the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p053"><p>Most remarkably, perhaps, all of this occurred within the world’s most highly commercialized society, in which producing for the market, rather than for local consumption, became a very widespread phenomenon. Cheap transportation allowed peasants to grow specialized crops for sale, while they purchased rice or other staples on the market. In addition, government demands for taxes paid in cash rather than in kind required peasants to sell something — their products or their labor — in order to meet their obligations. The growing use of paper money as well as financial instruments such as letters of credit and promissory notes further contributed to the commercialization of Chinese society. Two prominent scholars have described the outcome: “Output increased, population grew, skills multiplied, and a burst of inventiveness made Song China far wealthier than ever before — or than any of its contemporaries.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-001_10">10</span> (See <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_chinese_technological_achievements.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot: Chinese Technological Achievements</span>.)</p></div>
