<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p081"><p>The most significant expansion of Orthodox Christianity occurred among the Slavic peoples of what is now Ukraine and western Russia. In this culturally diverse region, which also included Finnic and Baltic peoples as well as Viking traders, a modest state known as Kievan Rus (KE<span data-block_type="nobr">E-</span><wbr/>yeh<span data-block_type="nobr">v-</span><wbr/>ihn ROOS) — named after the most prominent city, Kiev — emerged in the ninth century. As in many of the new thir<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations, the development of Rus was stimulated by trade, in this case along the Dnieper River, linking Scandinavia and Byzantium. Loosely led by various princes, especially the prince of Kiev, Rus was a society of slaves and freemen, privileged people and commoners, dominant men and subordinate women. This stratification marked it as a thir<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilization in the making (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch10/STR_02272_10_M03.html" data-target="_pop">Map 10.3</span>).</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p082"><p>Religion reflected the region’s cultural diversity, with the gods and practices of many peoples much in evidence. Ancestral spirits, household deities, and various gods related to the forces of nature were in evidence, with Perun, the god of thunder, perhaps the most prominent. Small numbers of Christians, Muslims, and Jews were likewise part of the mix. Then, in the late tenth century, 988 to be precise, a decisive turning point occurred. The growing interaction of Rus with the larger world prompted Prince Vladimir of Kiev to affiliate with the Eastern Orthodox faith of the Byzantine Empire. He was searching for a religion that would unify the diverse peoples of his region, while linking Rus into wider networks of communication and exchange. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch10_11.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: 988 and the Conversion of Russia</span> for a closer look at this momentous decision.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p085"><p>As elsewhere in Europe, the coming of Christianity to Rus was a top-down process in which ordinary people followed their rulers into the Church. It was also a slow process, and elements of traditional religious sensibility long lingered among those who defined themselves as Christian. Perun continued to speak to some, and “magicians” sometimes led people astray in the eyes of church authorities. But building churches on the site where idols to Perun and other gods once stood helped to anchor the new faith in its new land.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p086"><p>It was a fateful choice with long-term implications for Russian history, for it brought this fledgling civilization firmly into the world of Orthodox Christianity, separating it from both the realm of Islam and the Roman Catholic West. Like many new civilizations, Rus borrowed extensively from its older and more sophisticated neighbor. Among these borrowings were Byzantine architectural styles, the Cyrillic alphabet, the extensive use of icons, a monastic tradition stressing prayer and service, and political ideals of imperial control of the Church, all of which became part of a transformed Rus. Orthodoxy also provided a more unified identity for this emerging civilization and religious legitimacy for its rulers. Centuries later, when Byzantium had fallen to the Turks, a few Russian church leaders proclaimed the doctrine of a “third Rome.” The original Rome had abandoned the true Orthodox faith for Roman Catholicism, and the second Rome, Constantinople, had succumbed to Muslim infidels. Moscow was now the third Rome, the final protector and defender of Orthodox Christianity. Though not widely proclaimed in Russia itself, such a notion reflected the “Russification” of Eastern Orthodoxy and its growing role as an element of Russian national identity. It was also a reminder of the enduring legacy of a thousand years of Byzantine history, long after the empire itself had vanished.</p></div>
