<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p088"><p>Beyond liberation and feminism, a further dimension of cultural globalization took shape in the challenge that modernity presented to the world’s religions. To the most “advanced” thinkers of the past several hundred years — Enlightenment writers in the eighteenth century, Karl Marx in the nineteenth, and many academics and secula<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>minded intellectuals in the twentieth — religion was headed for extinction in the face of modernity, science, communism, or globalization. In some places — Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union, for example — religious belief and practice had declined sharply. Moreover, the spread of a scientific culture around the world persuaded small minorities everywhere, often among the most highly educated, that the only realities worth considering were those that could be measured with the techniques of science. To such people, all else was superstition, born of ignorance. Nevertheless, the far more prominent trends of the last century have been those that involved the further spread of major world religions, their resurgence in new forms, their opposition to elements of a secular and global modernity, and their political role as a source of community identity and conflict. Contrary to earlier expectations, religion has played an unexpectedly powerful role in this most recent century.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p035i"><p>Pay close attention to these changes among and within religions in the twentieth century.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p089"><p>Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam had long functioned as transregional cultures, spreading far beyond their places of origin. That process continued in the twentieth century. Buddhist ideas and practices such as meditation found a warm reception in the West, as did yoga, originally a mind-body practice of Indian origin. Christianity of various kinds spread widely in non-Muslim Africa and South Korea and less extensively in parts of India. By the end of the twentieth century, it was growing even in China, where perhaps 7 to 8 percent of China’s population — some 84 to 96 million people — claimed allegiance to the faith. No longer a primarily European or North American religion, Christianity by the early twenty-first century found some 62 percent of its adherents in Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. In some instances, missionaries from those regions have set about the “re-evangelization” of Europe and North America. Moreover, millions of migrants from the Islamic world have planted their religion solidly in the West. In the United States, for example, a substantial number of African Americans and smaller numbers of European Americans engage in Islamic practice. For several decades, the writings of the thirteenth-century Islamic Sufi poet Rumi have been best sellers in the United States. Religious exchange, in short, has been a two-way street, not simply a transmission of Western ideas to the rest of the world. More than ever before, religious pluralism characterizes many of the world’s societies, confronting people with the need to make choices in a domain of life previously regarded as given and fixed.</p></div>
