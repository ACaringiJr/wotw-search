<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-fm01-sec1-017">Change, Comparison, and Connection: The Three Cs of World History
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="fm-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1009"><p>Despite much debate and argument, one thing is reasonably clear: in world history, nothing stands alone. Every event, every historical figure, every culture, society, or civilization gains significance from its inclusion in some larger context. Most world historians would probably agree on three such contexts that define their field of study. Each of those contexts confronts a particular problem in our understanding of the past.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1010"><p>The first context in which the particulars of world history can be situated is that of <strong>change</strong> over time. In world history, it is the “big picture” change<span data-block_type="nobr">s—</span><wbr/>those that affect large segments of humankin<span data-block_type="nobr">d—</span><wbr/>that are of greatest interest. How did the transition from a gathering and hunting economy to one based on agriculture take place? How did cities, empires, and civilizations take shape in various parts of the world? What lay behind the emergence of a new balance of global power after 1500, one that featured the growing prominence of Europe on the world stage? What generated the amazing transformations of the “revolution of modernity” in recent centuries? How did the lives of women change as a result of industrialization?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1011"><p>A focus on change provides an antidote to a persistent tendency of human thinking that historians call “essentialism.” A more common term is “stereotyping.” It refers to our inclination to define particular groups of people with an unchanging or essential set of characteristics. Women are nurturing; peasants are conservative; Americans are aggressive; Hindus are religious. Serious students of history soon become aware that every significant category of people contains endless divisions and conflicts and that those human communities are constantly in flux. Peasants may often accept the status quo, except of course when they rebel, as they frequently have. Americans have experienced periods of isolationism and withdrawal from the world as well as times of aggressive engagement with it. Things change.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_PRO-7"><p>PRO-7</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1013"><p>But some things persist, even if they also change. We should not allow an emphasis on change to blind us to the continuities of human experience. A recognizably Chinese state has operated for more than 2,000 years. Slavery and patriarchy persisted as human institutions for thousands of years until they were challenged in recent centuries, and in various forms they exist still. The teachings of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam have endured for centuries, though with endless variations and transformations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1014"><p>A second major context that operates constantly in world history books and courses is that of <strong>comparison</strong>. Whatever else it may be, world history is a comparative discipline, seeking to identify similarities and differences in the experience of the world’s Peoples. What is the difference between the development of agriculture in the Middle East and in Mesoamerica? Was the experience of women largely the same in all patriarchal societies? What did the Roman Empire and Han dynasty China have in common? Why did the Industrial Revolution and a modern way of life evolve first in Western Europe rather than somewhere else? What distinguished the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions from one another? What different postures toward modernity emerged within the Islamic world? Describing and, if possible, explaining such similarities and differences are among the major tasks of world history. Comparison, then, is a recurring theme in this book, with expressions in every chapter.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1015"><p>Comparison has proven an effective tool in efforts to counteract Eurocentrism, the notion that Europeans or people of European descent have long been the primary movers and shakers of the historical process. That notion arose in recent centuries when Europeans were in fact the major source of innovation in the world and did for a time exercise something close to world domination. This temporary preeminence decisively shaped the way Europeans thought and wrote about their own histories and those of other people. In their own eyes, Europeans alone were progressive people, thanks to some cultural or racial superiority. Everyone else was to some degree stagnant, backward, savage, or barbarian. The unusual power of Europeans allowed them for a time to act on those beliefs and to convey such ways of thinking to much of the world. But comparative world history sets European achievements in a global and historical context, helping us to sort out what was distinctive about the development of Europe and what similarities it bore to other major regions of the world. Puncturing the pretensions of Eurocentrism has been high on the agenda of world history.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1016"><p>A third context that informs world history involves the interactions, encounters, and <strong>connections</strong> among different and often distant Peoples. World history is less about what happened within particular civilizations or cultures than about the processes and outcomes of their meetings with one another. Focusing on cross-cultural connections—whether those of conflict or more peaceful exchange—represents an effort to counteract a habit of thinking about particular Peoples, states, or cultures as self-contained or isolated communities. Despite the historical emergence of many separate and distinct societies, none of them developed alone. Each was embedded in a network of relationships with both near and more distant peoples.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_PRO-8"><p>PRO-8</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1018"><p>Moreover, these cross-cultural connections did not begin with Columbus. The Chinese, for example, interacted continuously with the nomadic Peoples on their northern border; generated technologies that diffused across all of Eurasia; transmitted elements of their culture to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam; and assimilated a foreign religious tradition, Buddhism, which had originated in India. Though clearly distinctive, China was not a self-contained or isolated civilization.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1019"><p>The growing depth and significance of such cross-cultural relationships, known now as globalization, has been a distinguishing feature of the modern era. The voyages of Columbus brought the Peoples of the Eastern and Western hemispheres into sustained contact for the first time with enormous global consequences. Several centuries later, Europeans took advantage of their industrial power to bring much of the world temporarily under their control. The new technologies of the twentieth century have intertwined the economies, societies, and cultures of the world’s Peoples more tightly than ever before. During the past five centuries, the encounter with strangers, or at least with their ideas and practices, was everywhere among the most powerful motors of change in human societies. Thus world history remains always alert to the networks, webs, and cross-cultural encounters in which particular civilizations or Peoples were enmeshed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1020"><p>Changes, comparisons, and connections—all of them operating on a global scale—represent three contexts or frameworks that can help us bring some coherence to the multiple and complex stories of world history. They will recur repeatedly in the pages that follow.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="fm-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-fm01-p1021"><p>A final observation about this account of world history: <em>Ways of the World</em>, like all other world history textbooks, is radically unbalanced in terms of coverage. The first chapter, for example, takes on some 95 percent of the human story, well over 200,000 years of our history. By contrast, the last century alone occupies four entire chapters. In fact, the six major sections of the book deal with progressively shorter time periods, in progressively greater detail. This imbalance owes much to the relative scarcity of information about earlier periods of our history. But it also reflects a certain “present mindedness,” for we look to history, always, to make sense of our current needs and circumstances. And in doing so, we often assume that more recent events have a greater significance for our own lives in the here and now than those that occurred in more distant times. Whether you agree with this assumption or not, you will have occasion to ponder it as you consider the many and various “ways of the world” that have emerged in the course of the human journey and as you contemplate their relevance for your own journey.</p></div>
