<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p018"><p>While this panoramic perspective allows us to see the broadest outlines of the human journey, it also obscures much of great importance that took place during the second and third waves of the age of agrarian civilization. If we zoom in a bit more closely, significant changes emerge, even if they did not result in a thorough transformation of human life. Population, for example, grew more rapidly than ever before during this period, as the <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_world_population_during_the_age_of_agricultural_civilization1.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot</span> illustrates. Even though the overall trend was up, important fluctuations interrupted the pattern, especially during the first millennium <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, when little overall growth took place. Moreover, the rate of growth, though rapid in comparison with Paleolithic times, was quite slow if we measure it against the explosive expansion of recent centuries, when human numbers quadrupled in the twentieth century alone. This modest and interrupted pattern of population growth during the age of agrarian civilization reflected the absence of any fundamental economic breakthrough, which could have supported much larger numbers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p019"><p>Another change lies in the growing size of the states or empires that structured civilizations. The Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese empires of secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations, as well as the Arab, Mongol, and Inca empires of the third wave, all dwarfed the cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states of Mesopotamia and the Egypt of the pharaohs. Each of these empires brought together in a single political system a vast diversity of peoples. Even so, just to keep things in perspective, as late as the seventeenth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, only on<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>third of the world’s landmass was under the control of any stat<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based system, although these societies now encompassed a considerable majority of the world’s people.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p020a"><p>The rise and fall of these empires likewise represented very consequential changes to the people who experienced them. In the course of its growth, the Roman Empire utterly destroyed the city of Carthage in North Africa, with the conquerors allegedly sowing the ground with salt so that nothing would ever grow there again. Similar bloodshed and destruction accompanied the creation of other much-celebrated states. Their collapse also had a dramatic impact on the lives of their people. Scholars have estimated that the large population of Maya civilization shrank by some 85 percent in less than a century as that society dissolved around 840 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> It is difficult to imagine the sense of trauma and bewilderment associated with a collapse of this magnitude.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p021"><p>Second- and third-wave civilizations also generated important innovations in many spheres. Those in the cultural realm have been perhaps the most widespread and enduring. Distinctive “wisdom traditions” — the great philosophical/religious systems of Confucianism and Daoism in China; Hinduism and Buddhism in India; Greek rationalism in the Mediterranean; and Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam in the Middle East — have provided the moral and spiritual framework within which most of the world’s peoples have sought to order their lives and define their relationship to the mysteries of life and death. All of these philosophical and religious systems are the product of second- and third-wave civilizations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p022"><p>Although no technological breakthrough equivalent to the Agricultural or Industrial Revolution took place during this time, more modest innovations considerably enhanced human potential for manipulating the environment. China was a primary source of such technological change, though by no means the only one. “Chinese inventions and discoveries,” wrote one prominent historian, “passed in a continuous flood from East to West for twenty centuries before the scientific revolution.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-pt02-sec2-002_2">2</span> They included piston bellows, the draw-loom, silk-handling machinery, the wheelbarrow, a better harness for draft animals, the crossbow, iron casting, the iron-chain suspension bridge, gunpowder, firearms, the magnetic compass, paper, printing, and porcelain. India pioneered the crystallization of sugar and techniques for the manufacture of cotton textiles. Roman technological achievements were particularly apparent in construction and civil engineering — the building of roads, bridges, aqueducts, and fortifications — and in the art of glassblowing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p023"><p>Nor were social hierarchies immune to change and challenge. India’s caste system grew far more elaborate over time. Roman slaves and Chinese peasants on occasion rose in rebellion. Some Buddhist and Christian women found a measure of autonomy and opportunities for leadership and learning in the monastic communities of their respective traditions. Gender systems too fluctuated in the intensity with which women were subordinated to men. Generally women were less restricted in the initial phase of a civilization’s development and during times of disruption, while patriarchy limited women more sharply as a civilization matured and stabilized.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_101"><p>101</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p024"><p>A further process of change following the end of the First Civilizations lay in the emergence of far more elaborate, widespread, and dense networks of communication and exchange that connected many of the world’s peoples to one another. Many of the technologies mentioned here diffused widely across large areas, as did the religious and cultural traditions of second- and third-wave civilizations. Long-distance trade routes represented another form of transregional interaction. Caravan trade across northern Eurasia, seaborne commerce within the Indian Ocean basin, the exchange of goods across the Sahara, river-based commerce in the eastern woodlands of North America, various trading networks radiating from Mesoamerica — all of these carried goods, and sometimes disease, technology, culture, and religion as well. In the early centuries of the Common Era, for example, Southeast Asia attracted distant merchants and some settlers from both China and India, bringing Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism to various parts of that vast region. Disease also increasingly linked distant human communities. According to the famous Greek historian Thucydides, a mysterious plague “from parts of Ethiopia above Egypt” descended on Athens in 430 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, decimating the city.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-pt02-sec2-002_3">3</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p025"><p>In all of these ways, the world became quite different from what it had been in the age of the First Civilizations, even though fundamental economic and social patterns had not substantially changed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p026"><p>The first three chapters of Part Two focus in a thematic fashion on the Eurasian / North African civilizations of the second-wave era (600 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>-600 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), which hosted the vast majority of the world’s population, some 80 percent or more. <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch3_2.html">Chapter 3</span> introduces them by examining and comparing their political frameworks and especially the empires (great or terrible, depending on your point of view) that took shape in most of them. Far more enduring than their empires were the cultural or religious traditions that secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations generated. These are examined, also comparatively, in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch4_2.html">Chapter 4</span>. The social life of these civilizations, expressed in class, caste, slavery, and gender relationships, also varied considerably, as <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch5_2.html">Chapter 5</span> spells out. In <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch6_2.html">Chapter 6</span>, the historical spotlight turns to inner Africa, the Americas, and Pacific Oceania during the secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave era, asking whether their histories paralleled Eurasian patterns or explored alternative possibilities.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p027"><p>In recalling this secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave phase of the human journey, we will have occasion to compare the experiences of its various peoples, to note their remarkable achievements, to lament the tragedies that befell them and the suffering to which they gave rise, and to ponder their continuing power to fascinate us still.</p></div>
