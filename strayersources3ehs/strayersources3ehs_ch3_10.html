<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p064"><p>The rise of empires is among the perennial questions that historians tackle.

In a transformation of epic proportions, Rome subsequently became the center of an enormous imperial state that encompassed the Mediterranean basin and included parts of continental Europe, Britain, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p035k"><p>You should know differences in the features and dates of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p065"><p>Originally ruled by a king, around 509 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> Roman aristocrats threw off the monarchy and established a republic in which the men of a wealthy class, known as patricians, dominated. Executive authority was exercised by two consuls, who were advised by a patrician assembly, the Senate. Deepening conflict with the poorer classes, called plebeians (plih-BEE-uhns), led to important changes in Roman political life. A written code of law offered plebeians some protection from abuse; a system of public assemblies provided an opportunity for lower classes to shape public policy; and a new office of tribune, who represented plebeians, allowed them to block unfavorable legislation. Romans took great pride in this political system, believing that they enjoyed greater freedom than did many of their more autocratic neighbors. The values of the republic — rule of law, the rights of citizens, the absence of pretension, upright moral behavior, keeping one’s word — were later idealized as “the way of the ancestors.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p066"><p>With this political system and these values, the Romans launched their empire-building enterprise, a prolonged process that took more than 500 years (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch3/STR_02272_03_M04.html" data-target="_pop">Map 3.4</span>). It began in the 490s <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> with Roman control over its Latin neighbors in central Italy and over the next several hundred years encompassed most of the Italian peninsula. Between 264 and 146 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, victory in the Punic Wars with Carthage, a powerful empire with its capital in North Africa, extended Roman control over the western Mediterranean, including Spain, and made Rome a naval power. Subsequent expansion in the eastern Mediterranean brought the ancient civilizations of Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia under Roman domination. Rome also expanded into territories in Southern and Western Europe, including presen<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>day France and Britain. By early in the second century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, the Roman Empire had reached its maximum extent. Like classical Greece, that empire has been associated with Europe. But in its own time, elites in North Africa and Southwest Asia likewise claimed Roman identity, and the empire’s richest provinces were in the east.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p068"><p>How did Rome grow from a single city to the center of a huge empire?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p069"><p>No overall design or blueprint drove the building of empire, nor were there any precedents to guide the Romans. What they created was something wholly new — an empire that encompassed the entire Mediterranean basin and beyond. It was a piecemeal process, which the Romans invariably saw as defensive. Each addition of territory created new vulnerabilities, which could be assuaged only by more conquests. For some, the growth of empire represented opportunity. Poor soldiers hoped for land, loot, or salaries that might lift their families out of poverty. The wel<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>t<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>do or wel<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>connected gained great estates, earned promotions, and sometimes achieved public acclaim and high political office. The wealth of lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>established societies in the eastern Mediterranean (Greece and Egypt, for example) beckoned, as did the resources and food supplies of the less developed regions, such as Western Europe. There was no shortage of motivation for the creation of the Roman Empire.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p071"><p>Although Rome’s central location in the Mediterranean basin provided a convenient launching pad for empire, it was the army, “well-trained, well-fed, and well-rewarded,” that built the empire.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec2-005_10">10</span> Drawing on the growing population of Italy, that army was often brutal in war. Carthage, for example, was utterly destroyed; the city was razed to the ground, and its inhabitants were either killed or sold into slavery. Nonetheless, Roman authorities could be generous to former enemies. Some were granted Roman citizenship; others were treated as allies and allowed to maintain their local rulers. As the empire grew, so too did political forces in Rome that favored its continued expansion and were willing to commit the necessary manpower and resources.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_120"><p>120</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p072"><p>Centuries of empire building and the warfare that made it possible had an impact on Roman society and values. That vast process, for example, shaped Roman understandings of gender and the appropriate roles of men and women. Rome was becoming a warrior society in which the masculinity of upper-class male citizens was defined in part by a man’s role as a soldier and a property owner. In private life, this translated into absolute control over his wife, children, and slaves, including the theoretical right to kill them without interference from the state. This ability of a free man and a Roman citizen to act decisively in both public and private life lay at the heart of ideal male identity. A Roman woman could participate proudly in this warrior culture by bearing brave sons and inculcating these values in her offspring.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p073"><p>Strangely enough, by the early centuries of the Common Era the wealth of empire, the authority of the imperial state, and the breakdown of older Roman social patterns combined to offer women in the elite classes a less restricted life than they had known in the early centuries of the republic. Upper-class Roman women had never been as secluded in the home as were their Greek counterparts, and now the legal authority of their husbands was curtailed by the intrusion of the state into what had been private life. The head of household, or <em>pater familias</em>, lost his earlier power of life and death over his family. Furthermore, such women could now marry without transferring legal control to their husbands and were increasingly able to manage their own finances and take part in the growing commercial economy of the empire. According to one scholar, Roman women of the wealthier classes gained “almost complete liberty in matters of property and marriage.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec2-005_11">11</span> At the other end of the social spectrum, Roman conquests brought many thousands of women as well as men into the empire as slaves, who were often brutally treated and subject to the whims of their masters (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch5_14.html" data-target="_pop">“Slavery: The Case of the Roman Empire”</span> in Chapter 5).</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p074"><p>The relentless expansion of empire raised yet another profound question for Rome: could republican government and values survive the acquisition of a huge empire? The wealth of empire enriched a few, enabling them to acquire large estates and many slaves, while pushing growing numbers of free farmers into the cities and poverty. Imperial riches also empowered a small group of military leaders — Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Julius Caesar — who recruited their troops directly from the ranks of the poor and whose fierce rivalries brought civil war to Rome during the first century <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> Traditionalists lamented the apparent decline of republican values — simplicity, service, free farmers as the backbone of the army, the authority of the Senate — amid the sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>seeking ambition of the newly rich and powerful. When the dust settled from the civil war, Rome was clearly changing, for authority was now vested primarily in an emperor, the first of whom was Octavian, later granted the title of Augustus (r. 27 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>–14 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), which implied a divine status for the ruler. The republic was history; Rome had become an empire and its ruler an emperor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_121"><p>121</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p075"><p>But it was an empire with an uneasy conscience, for many felt that in acquiring an empire, Rome had betrayed and abandoned its republican origins. Augustus was careful to maintain the forms of the republic — the Senate, consuls, public assemblies — and referred to himself as “first man” rather than “king” or “emperor,” even as he accumulated enormous personal power. And in a bow to republican values, he spoke of the empire’s conquests as reflecting the “power of the Roman people” rather than of the Roman state. Despite this rhetoric, he was emperor in practice, if not in name, for he was able to exercise sole authority, backed up by his command of a professional army. Later emperors were less reluctant to flaunt their imperial prerogatives.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p076"><p>During the first two centuries <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, this empire in disguise provided security, grandeur, and relative prosperity for the Mediterranean world. In 155 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, Aelius Aristides, one of the empire’s Greek subjects from the west coast of Anatolia and himself a Roman citizen, expressed this perspective as he praised the empire to the sky in front of the emperor Antonius:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p077"><p>Everywhere you have made citizens all those who are the more accomplished, noble and powerful people, even if they retain their native affinities…. No envy walks in your empire…. There has arisen a single harmonious government which has embraced all men…. And the whole inhabited world, as it were attending a national festival, has laid aside … the carrying of weapons…. Now it is possible for both Greek and barbarian to travel easily wherever he wishes.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec2-005_12">12</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p078"><p>This was the <em>pax Romana</em>, the Roman peace, the era of imperial Rome’s greatest extent and greatest authority.</p></div>
