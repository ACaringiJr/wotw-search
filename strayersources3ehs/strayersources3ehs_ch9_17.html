<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0112"><p>At the same time as India was being subjected to Turkic invasion, so too was Anatolia (now modern Turkey), where the largely Christian and Gree<span data-block_type="nobr">k-</span><wbr/>speaking population was then governed by the Byzantine Empire (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch9/STR_02272_09_M02.html" data-target="_pop">Map 9.2</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch9/STR_02272_09_M05.html" data-target="_pop">Map 9.5</span>). Here, as in India, the invaders initially wreaked havoc as Byzantine authority melted away in the eleventh century. Sufi practitioners likewise played a major role in the process of conversion. The outcome, however, was a far more profound cultural transformation than in India. By 1500, the population was 90 percent Muslim and largely Turki<span data-block_type="nobr">c-</span><wbr/>speaking, and Anatolia was the heartland of the powerful Turkish Ottoman Empire that had overrun Christian Byzantium. Why did the Turkic intrusion into Anatolia generate a much more thorough Islamization than in India?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0114"><p>In what ways was Anatolia changed by its incorporation into the Islamic world?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0115"><p>One factor clearly lies in a very different demographic balance. The population of Anatolia — perhaps 8 million — was far smaller than India’s roughly 48 million people, but far more Turki<span data-block_type="nobr">c-</span><wbr/>speaking peoples settled in Anatolia, giving them a much greater cultural weight than the smaller colonizing force in India. Furthermore, the disruption of Anatolian society was much more extensive. Massacres, enslavement, famine, and flight led to a sharp drop in the native population. The Byzantine state had been fatally weakened. Church properties were confiscated, and monasteries were destroyed or deserted. Priests and bishops were sometimes unable to serve their congregations. Christians, though seldom forced to convert, suffered many discriminations. They had to wear special clothing and pay special taxes, and they were forbidden to ride saddled horses or carry swords. Not a few Christians came to believe that these disasters represented proof that Islam was the true religion. Thus Byzantine civilization in Anatolia, previously focused on the centralized institutions of church and state, was rendered leaderless and dispirited, whereas India’s decentralized civilization, lacking a unified political or religious establishment, was better able to absorb the shock of external invasion while retaining its core values and identity.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_386"><p>386</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0116"><p>The Turkish rulers of Anatolia built a new society that welcomed converts and granted them material rewards and opportunity for high office. Moreover, the cultural barriers to conversion were arguably less severe than in India. The common monotheism of Islam and Christianity, and Muslim respect for Jesus and the Christian scriptures, made conversion easier than crossing the great gulf between Islam and Hinduism. Such similarities lent support to the suggestion of some Sufi teachers that the two religions were but different versions of the same faith. Sufis also established schools, mills, orchards, hospices, and rest places for travelers and thus replaced the destroyed or decaying institutions of Christian Anatolia. All of this contributed to the thorough religious transformation of Anatolia and laid a foundation for the Ottoman Empire, which by 1500 had become the most impressive and powerful state within the Islamic world.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch09-p0117"><p>But the Islamization of Anatolia occurred within a distinctly Turkish context. A Turkish language, not Arabic, predominated. Some Sufi religious practices, such as ecstatic turning dances, actually derived from Central Asian Turkic shamanism. And Turkic tradition, common among pastoral peoples, offered a freer, more gender-equal life for women. This practice caught the attention of the Arab Moroccan visitor Ibn Battuta during his travels among the Turks in the fourteenth century. He commented, “A remarkable thing that I saw … was the respect shown to women by the Turks, for they hold a more dignified position than the men…. The windows of the tent are open and her face is visible, for the Turkish women do not veil themselves.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch09-sec2-009_21">21</span> He was not pleased.</p></div>
