</div></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p010"><p>Studying world history has much in common with using the zoom lens of a camera. Sometimes, we pull the lens back to get a picture of the broadest possible panorama. At other times, we zoom in a bit for a middle-range shot, or even farther for a close-up of some particular feature of the historical landscape. Students of world history soon become comfortable with moving back and forth among these several perspectives.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p011"><p>As we bid farewell to the First Civilizations, we will take the opportunity to pull back the lens and look broadly, and briefly, at the entire age of agricultural civilizations, a period from about 3500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, when the earliest of the First Civilizations arose, to about 1750 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, when the first Industrial Revolution launched a new and distinctively modern phase of world history. During these more than 5,000 years, the most prominent large-scale trend was the globalization of civilization as this new form of human community increasingly spread across the planet, encompassing more people and larger territories.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p012"><p>The first wave of that process, addressed in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch2_2.html">Chapter 2</span>, was already global in scope, with expressions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Those First Civilizations generated the most impressive and powerful human societies created thus far, but they proved fragile and vulnerable as well. The alway<span data-block_type="nobr">s-</span><wbr/>quarreling cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states of ancient Mesopotamia had long ago been absorbed into the larger empires of Babylon and Assyria. By the middle of the second millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, the Indus Valley, Central Asian, and Norte Chico civilizations had collapsed or faded away. Egypt too fell victim to a series of foreign invaders during the first millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, including the forces of Nubia, Assyria, Alexander the Great, and the Roman Empire. The end of Olmec civilization around 400 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> has long puzzled historians, for it seems that the Olmecs themselves razed and then abandoned their major cities even as their civilizational style spread to neighboring peoples. About the same time, China’s Zhou dynasty kingdom fragmented into a series of competing states.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p013"><p>Even though these First Civilizations broke down, there was no going back. Civilization as a form of human community proved durable and resilient as well as periodically fragile. Thus, in the millennium between 600 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> and 600 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, new or enlarged urba<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>centered and stat<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based societies emerged to replace the First Civilizations in the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, India, China, Mesoamerica, and the Andes. Furthermore, smaller expressions of civilization began to take shape elsewhere — in Ethiopia and West Africa, in Japan and Indonesia, in Vietnam and Cambodia. In short, the development of civilization was becoming a global process.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_98"><p>98</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt02-p014"><p>Many of these second-wave civilizations likewise perished, as the collapse of the Roman Empire, Han dynasty China, and the Maya cities reminds us. They were followed by yet a third wave of civilizations, from roughly 600 to 1450 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_pt3_1.html">Part Three</span>). Some of them represented the persistence or renewal of older patterns, as in the case of China, for example, while elsewhere — such as in Western Europe, Russia, Japan, and West Africa — newer civilizations emerged, all of which borrowed heavily from their mor<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>established neighbors. The largest of these, Islamic civilization, incorporated a number of older centers of civilization, Egypt and Mesopotamia, for example, under the umbrella of a new religion. Thus the globalization of civilization continued apace. So too did the interaction of civilizations with one another and with the gathering and hunting peoples, agricultural village societies, and pastoral communities who were their neighbors.</p></div>
