</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p079"><p>At one level, European colonial empires were but the latest in a very long line of imperial creations, all of which had enlisted cooperation and experienced resistance from their subject peoples, but the nineteent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century European version of empire was distinctive in several remarkable ways. One was the prominence of race in distinguishing rulers and ruled, as the high tide of “scientific racism” in Europe coincided with the acquisition of Asian and African colonies. In East Africa, for example, white men expected to be addressed as <em>bwana</em> (Swahili for “master”), whereas Europeans regularly called African men “boy.” Education for colonial subjects was both limited and skewed toward practical subjects rather than scientific and literary studies, which were widely regarded as inappropriate for the “primitive mind” of “natives.” Particularly affected by European racism were those whose Western education and aspirations most clearly threatened the racial divide. Europeans were exceedingly reluctant to allow even the most highly educated Asians and Africans to enter the higher ranks of the colonial civil service. A proposal in 1883 to allow Indian judges to hear cases involving whites provoked outrage and massive demonstrations among European inhabitants of India.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p082"><p>What was distinctive about European colonial empires of the nineteenth century?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p080"><p>In those colonies that had a large European settler population, the pattern of racial separation was much more pronounced than in places such as Nigeria, which had few permanently settled whites. The most extreme case was South Africa, where a large European population and the widespread use of African labor in mines and industries brought blacks and whites into closer and more prolonged contact than elsewhere. The racial fears that were aroused resulted in extraordinary efforts to establish race as a legal, not just a customary, feature of South African society. This racial system provided for separate “homelands,” educational systems, residential areas, public facilities, and much more. In what was eventually known as apartheid, South African whites attempted the impossible task of creating an industrializing economy based on cheap African labor, while limiting African social and political integration in every conceivable fashion.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p083"><p>A further distinctive feature of nineteenth-century European empires lay in the extent to which colonial states were able to penetrate the societies they governed. Centralized tax-collecting bureaucracies, new means of communication and transportation, imposed changes in landholding patterns, integration of colonial economies into a global network of exchange, public health and sanitation measures, and the activities of missionaries — all of this touched the daily lives of many people far more deeply than in earlier empires. Not only were Europeans foreign rulers, but they also bore the seeds of a very different way of life, which grew out of their own modern transformation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p084"><p>Nineteenth-century European colonizers were extraordinary as well in their penchant for counting and classifying their subject people. With the assistance of anthropologists and missionaries, colonial governments collected a vast amount of information, sought to organize it “scientifically,” and used it to manage the unfamiliar, complex, varied, and fluctuating societies that they governed. In India, the British found in classical texts and Brahmin ideology an idealized description of the caste system, based on the notion of four ranked and unchanging varnas, which made it possible to bring order out of the immense complexity and variety of caste as it actually operated. Thus the British invented or appropriated a Brahmin version of “traditional India” that they favored and sought to preserve, while scorning as “non-Indian” the new elite who had been educated in European schools and were enthusiastic about Western ways of life. This view of India reflected the great influence of Brahmins on British thinking and clearly served the interests of this Indian upper class.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_801"><p>801</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p085"><p>Likewise, within African colonies Europeans identified, and sometimes invented, distinct tribes, each with its own clearly defined territory, language, customs, and chief. The notion of a “tribal Africa” expressed the Western view that African societies were primitive or backward, representing an earlier stage of human development. It was also a convenient idea, for it reduced the enormous complexity and fluidity of African societies to a more manageable state and thus made colonial administration easier.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p086"><p>Gender too entered into the efforts of Europeans to define both themselves and their newly acquired subject peoples. European colonizers — mostly male — took pride in their “active masculinity” while defining the “conquered races” as soft, passive, and feminine. Indian Bengali men, wrote a British official in 1892, “are disqualified for political enfranchisement by the possession of essentially feminine characteristics.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch18-sec2-002_12">12</span> By linking the inferiority of women with that of people of color, gender ideology and race prejudice were joined in support of colonial rule. But the intersection of race, gender, and empire was complex and varied. European men in the colonies often viewed their own women as the bearers and emblems of civilization, “upholding the moral dignity of the white community” amid the darkness of inferior peoples.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch18-sec2-002_13">13</span> As such, European women had to be above reproach in sexual matters, protected against the alleged lust of native men by their separation from local African or Asian societies. Furthermore, certain colonized people, such as the Sikhs and Gurkhas in India, the Kamba in Kenya, and the Hausa in Nigeria, were gendered as masculine or “martial races” and targeted for recruitment into British military or police forces.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p087"><p>Finally, the colonial policies of Europeans contradicted their own core values and their practices at home to an unusual degree. While nineteenth-century Britain and France were becoming more democratic, their colonies were essentially dictatorships, offering perhaps order and stability, but certainly not democratic government, because few colonial subjects were participating citizens. Empire, of course, was wholly at odds with European notions of national independence, and ranked racial classifications went against the grain of both Christian and Enlightenment ideas of human equality. Furthermore, many Europeans were distinctly reluctant to encourage within their colonies the kind of modernization — urban growth, industrialization, individual values, religious skepticism — that was sweeping their own societies. They feared that this kind of social change, often vilified as “detribalization,” would encourage unrest and challenge colonial rule. As a model for social development, they much preferred “traditional” rural society, with its established authorities and social hierarchies, though shorn of abuses such as slavery and <em>sati</em> (widow burning). Such contradictions between what Europeans embraced at home and what they practiced in the colonies became increasingly apparent to many Asians and Africans and played a major role in undermining the foundations of colonial rule in the twentieth century.</p></div>
