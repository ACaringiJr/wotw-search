</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p094"><p>Whatever the precise origins of patriarchy, women’s subordination permeated the First Civilizations, marking a gradual change from the more equal relationships of men and women within agricultural villages or Paleolithic bands. By the second millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> in Mesopotamia, various written laws codified and sought to enforce a patriarchal family life that offered women a measure of paternalistic protection while insisting on their submission to the unquestioned authority of men. Central to these laws was the regulation of female sexuality. A wife caught sleeping with another man might be drowned at her husband’s discretion, whereas he was permitted to enjoy sexual relations with his female servants, though not with another man’s wife. Divorce was far easier for the husband than for the wife. Rape was a serious offense, but the injured party was primarily the father or the husband of the victim, rather than the violated woman herself. While wealthy women might own and operate their own businesses or act on behalf of their powerful husbands, they too saw themselves as dependent. “Let all be well with [my husband],” prayed one such wife, “that I may prosper under his protection.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-006_11">11</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p097"><p>How did Mesopotamian and Egyptian patriarchy differ from each other?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p095"><p>Furthermore, women in Mesopotamian civilization were sometimes divided into two sharply distinguished categories. Under an Assyrian law code that was in effect between the fifteenth and eleventh centuries <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, respectable women, those under the protection and sexual control of one man, were required to be veiled when outside the home, whereas nonrespectable women, such as slaves and prostitutes, were forbidden to wear veils and were subject to severe punishment if they presumed to cover their heads.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p098"><p>Finally, in some places, the powerful goddesses of earlier times were gradually relegated to the home and hearth. They were replaced in the public arena by dominant male deities, who now were credited with the power of creation and fertility and viewed as the patrons of wisdom and learning. This “demotion of the goddess,” argued historian Gerda Lerner, found expression in the Hebrew Scriptures, in which a single male deity, Yahweh (YAH-way), alone undertakes the act of creation without any participation of a female counterpart. Yet this demotion did not occur always or everywhere; in Mesopotamia, for example, the prominent goddess Inanna, or Istar, long held her own against male gods and was regarded as a goddess of love and sexuality as well as a war deity. In a hymn to Inanna dating to around 2250 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, the poet and priestess Enheduanna declared: “It is her game to speed conflict and battle, untiring, strapping on her sandals.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p099"><p>Thus expressions of patriarchy varied among the First Civilizations. Egypt, while clearly patriarchal, afforded its women greater opportunities than did most other First Civilizations. In Egypt, women were recognized as legal equals to men, able to own property and slaves, to administer and sell land, to make their own wills, to sign their own marriage contracts, and to initiate divorce. Moreover, married women in Egypt were not veiled as they were at times in Mesopotamia. Royal women occasionally exercised significant political power, acting as regents for their young sons or, more rarely, as queens in their own right. Clearly, though, this was seen as abnormal, for Egypt’s most famous queen, Hatshepsut (r. 1472–1457 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>), was sometimes portrayed in statues as a man, dressed in male clothing and sporting the traditional false beard of the pharaoh.</p></div>
