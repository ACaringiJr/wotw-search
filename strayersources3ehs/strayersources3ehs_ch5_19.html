Until quite recently, women’s subordination in all civilizations has been so widespread and pervasive that historians have been slow to recognize that gender systems had a history, changing over time. New agricultural technologies, the rise or decline of powerful states, the incorporation of world religions, interaction with culturally different peoples — all of these developments and more generated significant change in understandings of what was appropriate masculine and feminine behavior. Most often, patriarchies were lighter and less restrictive for women in the early years of a civilization’s development and during times of upheaval, when established patterns of male dominance were disrupted.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p0119"><p>Furthermore, women were often active agents in the histories of their societies, even while largely accepting their overall subordination. As the central figures in family life, they served as repositories and transmitters of their peoples’ culture. Some were able to occupy unorthodox and occasionally prominent positions outside the home as scholars, religious functionaries, managers of property and participants in commerce, and even as rulers or military leaders. In Britain, Egypt, and Vietnam, for example, women led efforts to resist their countries’ incorporation into the Roman or Chinese empires. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch3_13.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Trung Trac in Chapter 3</span>, and the <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch3/STR_02272_03_P04.html" data-target="_pop">statue of Boudica</span>.) Both Buddhist and Christian nuns carved out small domains of relative freedom from male control. But these changes or challenges to male dominance occurred within a patriarchal framework, and nowhere did they evolve out of or beyond that framework. Thus a kind of “patriarchal equilibrium” ensured the lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>term persistence of women’s subordination despite fluctuations and notwithstanding various efforts to redefine gender roles or push against gendered expectations.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch05-sec1-004_16">16</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p0120"><p>Nor was patriarchy everywhere the same. Restrictions on women were far sharper in urban-based civilizations than in those pastoral or agricultural societies that lay beyond the reach of cities and empires. The degree and expression of patriarchy also varied from one civilization to another, as the discussion of Mesopotamia and Egypt in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch2_2.html">Chapter 2</span> illustrated. And within particular civilizations, elite women both enjoyed privileges and suffered the restrictions of seclusion in the home to a much greater extent than their lowe<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>class counterparts whose economic circumstances required them to operate in the larger social arena. China provides a fascinating example of how patriarchy changed over time, while the contrasting patriarchies of Athens and Sparta illustrate clear variations even within the much smaller world of Greek civilization.</p></div>
