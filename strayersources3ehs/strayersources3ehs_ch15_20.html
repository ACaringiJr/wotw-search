<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p0147"><p>In the long run, the achievements of the Scientific Revolution spread globally, becoming the most widely sough<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>after product of European culture and far more desired than Christianity, democracy, socialism, or Western literature. In the early modern era, however, interest in European scientific thinking within major Asian societies was both modest and selective. The telescope provides an example. Invented in early seventeent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century Europe and endlessly improved in the centuries that followed, the telescope provoked enormous excitement in European scientific circles. It made possible any number of astronomical discoveries, including the rugged surface of the moon, the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and the phases of Venus. “We are here … on fire with these things,” wrote an English astronomer in 1610.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-012_31">31</span> Soon the telescope was available in China, Mughal India, and the Ottoman Empire. But in none of these places did it evoke much interest or evolve into the kind of “discovery machine” that it was rapidly becoming in Europe.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p0148"><p>In China, Qing dynasty emperors and scholars were most interested in European techniques, derived largely from Jesuit missionaries, for predicting eclipses, reforming the calendar, and making accurate maps of the empire. European medicine, however, was of little importance for Chinese physicians before the nineteenth century. But the reputation of the Jesuits suffered when it became apparent in the 1760s that for two centuries the missionaries had withheld information about Copernican views of a su<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>centered solar system because those ideas had been condemned by the Church. Nonetheless, European science had a substantial impact on a number of Chinese scholars as it seemed compatible with the dat<span data-block_type="nobr">a-</span><wbr/>based kaozheng movement, described by one participant as “an an<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>like accumulation of facts.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-012_32">32</span> European mathematics was of particular interest to kaozheng researchers who were exploring the history of Chinese mathematics. To convince their skeptical colleagues that the barbarian Europeans had something to offer in this field, some Chinese scholars argued that European mathematics had in fact grown out of much earlier Chinese ideas and could therefore be adopted with comfort.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-012_33">33</span> In such ways, early modern Chinese thinkers selectively assimilated Western science very much on their own terms.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-012_34">34</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p0151"><p>Although Japanese authorities largely closed their country off from the West in the early seventeenth century (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch14_2.html">Chapter 14</span>), one window remained open. Alone among Europeans, the Dutch were permitted to trade in Japan at a single location near Nagasaki, but not until 1720 did the Japanese lift the ban on importing Western books. Then a number of European texts in medicine, astronomy, geography, mathematics, and other disciplines were translated and studied by a small group of Japanese scholars. They were especially impressed with Western anatomical studies, for in Japan dissection was work fit only for outcasts. Returning from an autopsy conducted by Dutch physicians in the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>eighteenth century, several Japanese observers reflected on their experience: “We remarked to each other how amazing the autopsy had been, and how inexcusable it had been for us to be ignorant of the anatomical structure of the human body.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-012_35">35</span> Nonetheless, this small center of “Dutch learning,” as it was called, remained isolated amid a pervasive Confucia<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>based culture. Not until the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>nineteenth century, when Japan was forcibly opened to Western penetration, would Europea<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>style science assume a prominent place in Japanese culture.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p035w"><p>Pay attention to the similar reactions of China, Japan, and the Ottoman Empire to the Scientific Revolution.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p0152"><p>Like China and Japan, the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was an independent, powerful, successful society whose intellectual elites saw no need for a wholesale embrace of things European. Ottoman scholars were conscious of the rich tradition of Muslim astronomy and chose not to translate the works of major European scientists such as Copernicus, Kepler, or Newton, although they were broadly aware of European scientific achievements by 1650. Insofar as they were interested in these developments, it was for their practical usefulness in making maps and calendars rather than for their larger philosophical implications. In any event, the notion of a su<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>centered solar system did not cause the kind of upset that it did in Europe.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p0153"><p>More broadly, theoretical science of any kind — Muslim or European — faced an uphill struggle in the face of a conservative Islamic educational system. In 1580, for example, a highly sophisticated astronomical observatory was dismantled under pressure from conservative religious scholars and teachers, who interpreted an outbreak of the plague as God’s disapproval with those who sought to understand his secrets. As in Japan, the systematic embrace of Western science would have to await the nineteenth century, when the Ottoman Empire was under far more intense European pressure and reform seemed more necessary.</p></div>
