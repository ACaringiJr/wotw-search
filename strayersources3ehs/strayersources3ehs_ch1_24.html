</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0132"><p>For thousands of years, people practiced agriculture using digging sticks or hoes, rather than plows, and even after plows came into use, many societies continued with ho<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based or horticultural farming. Most such ho<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based agricultural peoples lived in settled villages such as those of Banpo or Jericho, but to varying degrees they continued to augment their agricultural livelihood with gathering, hunting, and fishing. They also retained much of the social and gender equality of gathering and hunting communities, as they continued to do without kings, chiefs, bureaucrats, or aristocracies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0133"><p>An example of this type of social order can be found at Çatalhüyük (ch<span data-block_type="nobr">a-</span><wbr/>TAH<span data-block_type="nobr">L-</span><wbr/>ho<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>YOOK), a very early agricultural village in southern Turkey, which flourished between 7400 and 6000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> A careful excavation of the site revealed a population of several thousand people who buried their dead under their houses and then filled the houses with dirt and built new ones on top, layer upon layer. No streets divided the houses, which were constructed adjacent to one another. People moved about the village on adjoining rooftops, from which they entered their homes. Despite the presence of many specialized crafts, few signs of inherited social inequality have surfaced. Nor is there any indication of male or female dominance, although men were more closely associated with hunting wild animals and women with plants and agriculture. “Both men and women,” concludes one scholar, “could carry out a series of roles and enjoy a range of positions, from making tools to grinding grain and baking to heading a household.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch01-sec2-014_18">18</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0134"><p>In many horticultural villages, women’s critical role as farmers as well as their work in the spinning and weaving of textiles no doubt contributed to a social position of relative equality with men. Some such societies traced their descent through the female line and practiced marriage patterns in which men left their homes to live with their wives’ families. Archeologist Marija Gimbutas has highlighted the prevalence of female imagery in the art of early agricultural societies in Europe and Anatolia, which has suggested to her a widespread cult of the Goddess, focused on “the mystery of birth, death and the renewal of life.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch01-sec2-014_19">19</span> But early agriculture did not produce identical gender systems everywhere. Some societies practiced patrilineal descent and required a woman to live in the household of her husband. Grave sites in early Eastern European farming communities reveal fewer adult females than males, indicating perhaps the practice of female infanticide. Some early written evidence from China suggests a lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>term preference for male children. These variations in practice suggest that gender roles were likely determined more by cultural preference than by any biological need for a sexual division of labor and power.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0135"><p>In all of their diversity, many village-based agricultural societies flourished well into the modern era, usually organizing themselves in terms of kinship groups or lineages, which incorporated large numbers of people well beyond the immediate or extended family. Such a system provided the framework within which large numbers of people could make and enforce rules, maintain order, and settle disputes without going to war. In short, the lineage system performed the functions of government, but without the formal apparatus of government, and thus did not require kings or queens, chiefs, or permanent officials associated with a state organization. Despite their democratic qualities and the absence of centralized authority, village-based lineage societies sometimes developed modest social and economic inequalities. Elders could exploit the labor of junior members of the community and sought particularly to control women’s reproductive powers, which were essential for the growth of the lineage. People with special knowledge, skills, or experience could achieve higher status and greater influence. Among the Igbo of southern Nigeria well into the twentieth century, “title societies” enabled men and women of wealth and character to earn a series of increasingly prestigious “titles” that set them apart from other members of their community, although these honors could not be inherited. Lineages also sought to expand their numbers, and hence their prestige and power, by incorporating war captives or migrants in subordinate positions, sometimes as slaves.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0136"><p>Given the frequent oppressiveness of organized political power in human history, agricultural village societies represent an intriguing alternative to the states, kingdoms, and empires so often highlighted in the historical record. They pioneered the human settlement of vast areas; adapted to a variety of environments; maintained a substantial degree of social and gender equality; created numerous cultural, artistic, and religious traditions; and interacted continuously with their neighbors.</p></div>
