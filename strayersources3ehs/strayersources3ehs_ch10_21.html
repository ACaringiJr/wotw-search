</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0153"><p>Unlike the large centralized states of Byzantium, the Islamic world, and China, this thir<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave European civilization never regained the earlier unity it had under Roman rule. Rather, political life gradually crystallized into a system of competing states (France, Spain, England, Sweden, Prussia, the Netherlands, and Poland, among others) that has persisted into the twent<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>first century and that the European Union still confronts. Geographic barriers, ethnic and linguistic diversity, and the shifting balances of power among its many states prevented the emergence of a single European empire, despite periodic efforts to r<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>create something resembling the stil<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>remembered unity of the Roman Empire.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0156"><p>Why was Europe unable to achieve the kind of political unity that China experienced? What impact did this have on the subsequent history of Europe?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0154"><p>This multicentered political system shaped the emerging civilization of the West in many ways. It gave rise to frequent wars, enhanced the role and status of military men, and drove the “gunpowder revolution.” Thus European society and values were militarized far more than in China, which gave greater prominence to scholars and bureaucrats. Intense interstate rivalry, combined with a willingness to borrow, also stimulated European technological development. By 1500, Europeans had gone a long way toward catching up with their more advanced Asian counterparts in agriculture, industry, war, and sailing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0157"><p>Thus endemic warfare did not halt European economic growth. Capital, labor, and goods found their way around political barriers, while the common assumptions of Christian culture and the use of Latin and later French by the literate elite fostered communication across political borders. Europe’s multistate system thus provided enough competition to stimulate innovation, but it also preserved enough order and unity to allow the economy to grow.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0158"><p>The states within this emerging European civilization also differed from those to the east. Their rulers generally were weaker and had to contend with competing sources of power. Unlike the Orthodox Church in Byzantium, with its practice of caesaropapism, the Roman Catholic Church in the West maintained a degree of independence from state authority that served to check the power of kings and lords. European vassals had certain rights in return for loyalty to their lords and kings. By the thirteenth century, this meant that hig<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>ranking nobles, acting through formal councils, had the right to advise their rulers and to approve new taxes.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p035dd"><p>Note the similarities and differences in the functions of cities in Eurasia in the postclassical period.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0159"><p>This three-way struggle for power among kings, warrior aristocrats, and church leaders, all of them from the nobility, enabled urban-based merchants in Europe to achieve an unusual independence from political authority. Many cities, where wealthy merchants exercised local power, won the right to make and enforce their own laws and appoint their own officials. Some of them — Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and Milan, for example — became almost completely independent city-states. Elsewhere, kings granted charters that allowed cities to have their own courts, laws, and governments, while paying their own kind of taxes to the king instead of feudal dues. Powerful, independent cities were a distinctive feature of European life after 1100 or so. By contrast, Chinese cities, which were far larger than those of Europe, were simply part of the empire and enjoyed few special privileges. Although commerce was far more extensive in China than in the emerging European civilization, the powerful Chinese state favored the landowners over merchants, monopolized the salt and iron industries, and actively controlled and limited merchant activity far more than the new and weaker royal authorities of Europe were able to do.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0160"><p>The relative weakness of Europe’s rulers allowed urban merchants more leeway and, according to some historians, opened the way to a more thorough development of capitalism in later centuries. It also led to the development of representative institutions or parliaments through which the views and interests of these contending forces could be expressed and accommodated. Intended to strengthen royal authority by consulting with major social groups, these embryonic parliaments did not represent the “people” or the “nation” but instead embodied the three great “estates of the realm” — the clergy (the first estate), the landowning nobility (the second estate), and urban merchants (the third estate).</p></div>
