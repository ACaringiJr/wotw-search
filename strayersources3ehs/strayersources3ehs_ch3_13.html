Among the earliest examples of Vietnamese resistance to this occupation was that led around 40 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> by Trung Trac and her younger sister Trung Nhi, daughters in an aristocratic, military family. Trung Trac married a prominent local lord, Thi Sach, who was a vocal opponent of offensive Chinese policies — high taxes, even on the right to fish in local rivers; required payoffs to Chinese officials; and the imposition of Chinese culture on the Vietnamese. In response to this opposition, the Chinese governor of the region ordered Thi Sach’s execution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_124"><p>124</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p091"><p>This personal tragedy provoked Trung Trac to take up arms against the Chinese occupiers, and she quickly gained a substantial following among peasants and aristocrats alike. Famously addressing some 30,000 soldiers, while dressed in full military regalia rather than the expected mourning clothes, she declared to the assembled crowd:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-vrs-first" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p092"><p>Foremost I will avenge my country.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p093"><p>Second I will restore the Hung lineage.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-vrs-mid" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p094"><p>Third I will avenge the death of my husband.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-vrs-last" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p095"><p>Lastly I vow that these goals will be accomplished.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p096"><p>Within months, her forces had captured sixty-five towns, and, for two years, they held the Chinese at bay, while Trung Trac and Trung Nhi ruled a briefly independent state as co-queens. Chinese sources referred to Trung Trac as a “ferocious warrior.” During their rule, the sisters eliminated the hated tribute taxes imposed by the Chinese and sought to restore the authority of Vietnamese aristocrats. A large military force, said to number some 80,000, counted among its leaders thirty-six female “generals,” including the Trung sisters’ mother.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p097"><p>Soon, however, Chinese forces overwhelmed the rebellion, and Trung Trac’s support faded. Later Vietnamese records explained the failure of the revolt as a consequence of its female leadership. In traditional Vietnamese accounts, the Trung sisters committed suicide, jumping into a nearby river, as did a number of their followers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p098"><p>Although the revolt failed, it lived on in stories and legends to inspire later Vietnamese resistance to invaders — Chinese, French, Japanese, and American alike. Men were reminded that women had led this rebellion. “What a pity,” wrote a thirteenth-century Vietnamese historian, “that for a thousand years after this, the men of our land bowed their heads, folded their arms, and served the northerners [Chinese].”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-bx3-001_13">13</span> To this day, temples, streets, and neighborhoods bear the name of the Trung sisters, and a yearly celebration in their honor coincides with International Women’s Day. Usually depicted riding on war elephants and wielding swords, these two women also represent the more fluid gender roles then available to some Vietnamese women in comparison to the stricter patriarchy prevalent in China.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-que" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p099"><p>Question: How might you imagine the reactions to the Trung sisters’ revolt from Chinese officials; Vietnamese aristocrats; Vietnamese peasants, both male and female; and later generations of Vietnamese men and women?</p></div>
