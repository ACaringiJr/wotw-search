</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p0121"><p>Militant revolutionary fundamentalism has certainly not been the only religious response to modernity and globalization within the Islamic world. Many who shared a desire to embed Islamic values more centrally in their societies have acted peacefully and within established political structures. In Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Palestine, Morocco, Tunisia, and Lebanon, Islamic parties with various agendas made impressive electoral showings in the 1990s and the early twent<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>first century. Considerable debate among Muslims has raised questions about the proper role of the state, the difference between the eternal law of God (sharia) and the human interpretations of it, the rights of women, the possibility of democracy, and many other issues. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencecontendingforislamchapter22" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence: Contending for Islam, Chapter 22</span>.) Some Muslim intellectuals and political leaders have called for a dialogue between civilizations; others have argued that traditions can change in the face of modern realities without losing their distinctive Islamic character. In 1996, Anwar Ibrahim, a major political and intellectual figure in Malaysia, insisted:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p0122"><p>[Southeast Asian Muslims] would rather strive to improve the welfare of the women and children in their midst than spend their days elaborately defining the nature and institutions of the ideal Islamic state. They do not believe it makes one less of a Muslim to promote economic growth, to master the information revolution, and to demand justice for women.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch23-sec2-009_23">23</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p0123"><p>In Turkey, a movement inspired by the teachings of Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim scholar and preacher, has sought to apply the principles of Islamic spirituality and Sufi piety to the problems of modern society. Gaining a mass following in the 1990s and later, the Gulen movement has advocated interfaith and cross-cultural dialogue, multiparty democracy, nonviolence, and modern scientifically based education for girls and boys alike. Operating through schools, universities, conferences, newspapers, radio and TV stations, and various charities, it has a presence in more than 100 countries around the world. Claiming to be “faith-based but not faith limited,” the movement rejects the “fundamentalist” label even as it has challenged a wholly secular outlook on public life. And in 2004–2005, a gathering in Jordan of scholars from all major schools of Islamic thought issued the “Amman Message,” which called for Islamic unity, condemned terrorism, forbade Muslims from declaring one another as “apostate” or nonbelievers, and emphasized the commonalities shared by Muslims, Christians, and Jews.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p0124"><p>Within other religious traditions as well, believers found various ways of responding to global modernity. A number of liberal and mainstream Christian groups spoke to the ethical issues arising from economic globalization. Many Christian organizations, for example, were active in agitating for debt relief for poor countries. Pope John Paul II (r. 1978–2005) voiced his concern about “the growing distance between rich and poor, [and] unfair competition which puts the poor nations in a situation of ever-increasing inferiority.” Pope Francis (r. 2013– ), the first pontiff from Latin America, sought even more emphatically to direct the attention of Catholics toward the poor, the marginalized, and the suffering people of the world. Adherents of “liberation theology,” particularly in Latin America, sought a Christian basis for action in the areas of social justice, poverty, and human rights, while viewing Jesus as liberator as well as savior.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch23-p0125"><p>In Asia, a growing movement known as “socially engaged Buddhism” addressed the needs of the poor through social reform, educational programs, health services, and peacemaking action during times of conflict and war. A leading proponent of this approach was the Buddhist monk Maha Ghosananda. In the late 1970s, when Cambodia had been ravaged by the “killing fields” of the Khmer Rouge communist regime, he repeatedly visited the squalid refugee camps to which so many Cambodians had fled. There he led religious services, and later peace marches, endlessly reciting an ancient Buddhist chant: “Hatred never ceases by hatred, but by love alone is healed. This is an ancient and eternal law.” In short, religious responses to global modernity were articulated in many voices.</p></div>
