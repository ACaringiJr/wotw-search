<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p053"><p>The attention of historians often falls disproportionately on what is new. Although European commerce in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea certainly qualifies as “something new,” the European presence was far less significant in Asia than it was in the Americas or Africa during these centuries. European political control was limited to the Philippines, parts of Java, and a few of the Spice Islands. The small Southeast Asian state of Siam was able to expel the French in 1688, outraged by their aggressive religious efforts at conversion and their plotting to extend French influence. To the great powers of Asia — Mughal India, China, and Japan — Europeans represented no real military threat and played minor roles in their large and prosperous economies. Japan provides a fascinating case study in the ability of major Asian powers to control the European intruders.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p035j"><p>You need to know the roles of the <em>samurai</em> and the <em>daimyo</em> during the Tokugawa shogunate.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p054"><p>When Portuguese traders and missionaries first arrived in that island nation in the mid-sixteenth century, soon followed by Spanish, Dutch, and English merchants, Japan was plagued by endemic conflict among numerous feudal lords, known as <em>daimyo</em>, each with his own cadre of <em>samurai</em> warriors. In these circumstances, the European newcomers found a hospitable welcome, for their military technology, shipbuilding skills, geographic knowledge, commercial opportunities, and even religious ideas proved useful or attractive to various elements in Japan’s fractious and competitive society. The second half of the sixteenth century, for example, witnessed the growth of a substantial Christian movement, with some 300,000 converts and a Japanese-led church organization.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p055"><p>By the early seventeenth century, however, a series of remarkable military figures had unified Japan politically, under the leadership of a supreme military commander known as the <em>shogun</em>, who hailed from the Tokugawa clan. With the end of Japan’s civil wars, successive shoguns came to view Europeans as a threat to the country’s newly established unity rather than an opportunity. They therefore expelled Christian missionaries and violently suppressed the practice of Christianity. This policy included the execution, often under torture, of some sixty-two missionaries and thousands of Japanese converts. Shogunate authorities also forbade Japanese from traveling abroad and banned most European traders altogether, permitting only the Dutch, who appeared less interested in spreading Christianity, to trade at a single site. Thus, for two centuries (1650–1850), Japanese authorities of the Tokugawa shogunate largely closed their country off from the emerging world of European commerce, although they maintained their trading ties to China, Korea, and Southeast Asia.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p035k"><p>Take notes on the interactions between Japan and European traders in this era.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p056"><p>In the early seventeenth century, a large number of Japanese traders began to operate in Southeast Asia, where they behaved much like the newly arriving Europeans, frequently using force in support of their commercial interests. But unlike European states, the Japanese government of the Tokugawa shogunate explicitly disavowed any responsibility for or connection with these Japanese merchants. In one of many letters to rulers of Southeast Asian states, the Tokugawa shogun wrote to officials in Cambodia in 1610: “Merchants from my country [Japan] go to several places in your country [Cambodia] as well as Cochinchina and Champa [Vietnam]. There they become cruel and ferocious…. These men cause terrible damage…. They commit crimes and cause suffering…. Their offenses are extremely serious. Please punish them immediately according to the laws of your country. It is not necessary to have any reservations in this regard.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch14-sec2-004_9">9</span> Thus Japanese merchants lacked the kind of support from their government that European merchants consistently received, but they did not refrain from trading in Southeast Asia.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p057"><p>Nor did other Asian merchants disappear from the Indian Ocean, despite European naval dominance. Arab, Indian, Chinese, Javanese, Malay, Vietnamese, and other traders benefited from the upsurge in seaborne commerce. Resident communities of Chinese merchants inhabited many Southeast Asian port cities and dominated the growing spice trade between that region and China. Southeast Asian merchants, many of them women, continued a long tradition of involvement in international trade. Malay proverbs from the sixteenth century, for example, encouraged “teaching daughters how to calculate and make a profit.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch14-sec2-004_10">10</span> Overland trade within Asia remained wholly in Asian hands and grew considerably. Christian merchants from Armenia were particularly active in the commerce linking Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Tens of thousands of Indian merchants and moneylenders, mostly Hindus representing sophisticated family firms, lived throughout Central Asia, Persia, and Russia, thus connecting this vast region to markets in India. These international Asian commercial networks, equivalent in their commercial sophistication to those of Europe, continued to operate successfully even as Europeans militarized the seaborne commerce of the Indian Ocean.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch14-p058"><p>Within India, large and wealthy family firms, such as the one headed by Virji Vora during the seventeenth century, were able to monopolize the buying and selling of particular products, such as pepper or coral, and thus dictate terms and prices to the European trading companies. “He knoweth that wee must sell,” complained one English trader about Vora, “and so beats us downe till we come to his owne rates.” Furthermore, Vora was often the only source of loans for the cas<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>strapped Europeans, forcing them to pay interest rates as high as 12 to 18 percent annually. Despite their resentments, Europeans had little choice, because “none but Virji Vora hath moneye to lend or will lend.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch14-sec2-004_11">11</span></p></div>
