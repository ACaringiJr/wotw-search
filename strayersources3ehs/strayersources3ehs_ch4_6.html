</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p039"><p>Born to an aristocratic family in the state of Lu in northern China, Confucius (551–479 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>) was both learned and ambitious. Believing that he had found the key to solving China’s problem of disorder, he spent much of his adult life seeking a political position from which he might put his ideas into action. But no such opportunity came his way. Perhaps it was just as well, for it was as a thinker and a teacher that Confucius left a profound imprint on Chinese history and culture and also on other East Asian societies, such as Korea’s and Japan’s. After his death, his students collected his teachings in a short book called the <em>Analects</em>, and later scholars elaborated and commented endlessly on his ideas, creating a body of thought known as Confucianism.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p035d"><p>The political and cultural effects of Confucianism are among the most important concepts in all of China’s long history. Evidence continues on page 153.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p040"><p>The Confucian answer to the problem of China’s disorder was very different from that of the Legalists. Not laws and punishments, but the moral example of superiors was the Confucian key to a restored social harmony. For Confucius, human society consisted primarily of unequal relationships: the father was superior to the son; the husband to the wife; the older brother to the younger brother; and, of course, the ruler to the subject. If the superior party in each of these relationships behaved with sincerity, benevolence, and genuine concern for others, then the inferior party would be motivated to respond with deference and obedience. Harmony then would prevail. As Confucius put it, “The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows across it.” Thus, in both family life and in political life, the cultivation of <em>ren</em>— translated as human-heartedness, benevolence, goodness, nobility of heart — was the essential ingredient of a tranquil society.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p043"><p>But how were these humane virtues to be nurtured? Believing that people have a capacity for improvement, Confucius emphasized education as the key to moral betterment. He prescribed what we might call a broad liberal arts education emphasizing language, literature, history, philosophy, and ethics, all applied to the practical problems of government. Ritual and ceremonies were also important, for they conveyed the rules of appropriate behavior in the many and varying circumstances of life. For the “superior person,” or “gentleman” in Confucian terms, this process of improvement involved serious personal reflection and a willingness to strive continuously to perfect his moral character.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p035e"><p>The Confucian-based exam system, the concept of filial piety, and Confucian gender roles are all vital to understanding China’s history.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_153"><p>153</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p044"><p>Such ideas left a deep mark on Chinese culture. The discrediting of Legalism during the Qin dynasty opened the door to the adoption of Confucianism as the official ideology of the Chinese state, to such an extent that Confucianism became almost synonymous with Chinese culture. As China’s bureaucracy took shape during and after the Han dynasty, Confucianism became the central element of the educational system, which prepared students for the examinations required to gain official positions. In those examinations, candidates were required to apply the principles of Confucianism to specific situations that they might encounter in office. Thus generation after generation of China’s male elite was steeped in the ideas and values of Confucianism.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p045"><p>Family life had long been central to Chinese popular culture, expressed in the practice of ancestor veneration, including visiting the graves of the deceased, presenting them with offerings, and erecting commemorative tablets and shrines in their honor. In Confucian thinking, the family became a model for political life, a kind of miniature state. Filial piety, the honoring of one’s ancestors and parents, was both an end in itself and a training ground for the reverence due to the emperor and state officials.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p046"><p>Confucian views of the family were rigidly patriarchal and set the tone for defining the lives of women and men alike. Those views were linked to a hierarchical understanding of the cosmos in which an inferior and receptive earth was in balance with the superior and creative principle of Heaven. But these were gendered concepts, with Heaven associated with things male and earth with those female. Thus the subordinate and deferential position of women in relation to men was rooted in the structure of the cosmos itself. What this meant for women was spelled out by a somewhat later woman writer, Ban Zhao (bahn jow) (45–116 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), in a famous work called <em>Lessons for Women</em>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p047"><p>Let a woman modestly yield to others…. Always let her seem to tremble and to fear…. Then she may be said to humble herself before others…. To guard carefully her chastity …, to choose her words with care …, to wash and scrub filth away …, with whole-hearted devotion to sew and to weave, to love not gossip and silly laughter, in cleanliness and order to prepare the wine and food for serving guests: [these] may be called the characteristics of womanly work.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch04-sec2-002_4">4</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p048"><p>Ban Zhao called for greater attention to education for young girls, not because they were equal to boys, but so that a young woman might be better prepared to serve her husband. Education for boys, on the other hand, enabled them to more effectively control their wives.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p049"><p>Corresponding Confucian virtues for ideal men were contained in the paired concepts of <em>wen</em> and <em>wu</em>, both limited largely to males. The superior principle of wen referred to the refined qualities of rationality, scholarship, and literary and artistic abilities, while wu focused attention on physical and martial achievements. Thus men alone, and superior men at that, were eligible for the civil service exams that led to political office and high prestige, while military men and merchants occupied a distinctly lower position in a male social hierarchy.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch04-sec2-002_5">5</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_154"><p>154</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p050"><p>Beyond defining gender expectations, Confucianism also placed great importance on history, for the ideal good society lay in the past. Confucian ideas were reformist, perhaps even revolutionary, but they were consistently presented as an effort to restore a past golden age. Those ideas also injected a certain democratic element into Chinese elite culture, for the great sage had emphasized that “superior men” and potential government officials were those of outstanding moral character and intellectual achievement, not simply those of aristocratic background. Usually only young men from wealthy families could afford the education necessary for passing examinations, but on occasion villagers could find the resources to sponsor one of their bright sons, potentially propelling him into the stratosphere of the Chinese elite while bringing honor and benefit to the village itself.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p035f"><p>You should understand the importance of Confucian-based social hierarchies in East Asia.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p051"><p>Confucian values clearly justified the many inequalities of Chinese society, but they also established certain expectations for the superior parties in China’s social hierarchy. Thus emperors should keep taxes low, administer justice, and provide for the material needs of the people. Those who failed to govern by the moral norms of Confucian values forfeited the Mandate of Heaven and invited upheaval and their replacement by another dynasty. Likewise, husbands should deal kindly with their wives and children, lest they invite conflict and disharmony in the family.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p052"><p>Finally, Confucianism marked Chinese elite culture by its secular, or nonreligious, character. Confucius did not deny the reality of gods and spirits. In fact, he advised people to participate in family and state rituals “as if the spirits were present,” and he believed that the universe had a moral character with which human beings should align themselves. But the thrust of Confucian teaching was distinctly this-worldly and practical, concerned with human relationships, effective government, and social harmony. Asked on one occasion about his view of death and the spirits, Confucius replied that because we do not fully understand this life, we cannot possibly know anything about the life beyond. Members of the Chinese elite generally acknowledged that magic, the gods, and spirits were perhaps necessary for the lower orders of society, but educated people, they argued, would find them of little help in striving for moral improvement and in establishing a harmonious society.</p></div>
