<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p056"><p>It was the resources from agriculture that made possible one of the most distinctive features of the First Civilizations — cities. What would an agricultural villager have made of Uruk, ancient Mesopotamia’s largest city? Uruk had walls more than twenty feet tall and a population around 50,000 in the third millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> The city’s center, visible for miles around, was a stepped pyramid, or ziggurat, topped with a temple (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch2/STR_02272_02_P05.html" data-target="_pop">the photo of a ziggurat</span>). Inside the city, this village visitor would have found other temples as well, serving as centers of ritual performance and as places for the redistribution of stored food. Numerous craftspeople labored as masons, copper workers, and weavers and in many other specialties, while bureaucrats helped administer the city. It was, surely, a “vibrant, noisy, smelly, sometimes bewildering and dangerous, but also exciting place.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-003_6">6</span> Here is how the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, Mesopotamia’s ancient epic poem, describes the city:</p></div>

Workers lived in row upon row of standardized tw<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>room houses.

In shopping for obsidian blades, how was she to decide among the 350 workshops in the city? In seeking relatives, how could she find her way among many different compounds, each surrounded by a wall and housing a different lineage? And what would she make of a neighborhood composed entirely of Maya merchants from the distant coastal lowlands?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p068"><p>Cities, then, were central to most of the First Civilizations, though to varying degrees. They were political/administrative capitals; they functioned as centers for the production of culture, including art, architecture, literature, ritual, and ceremony; they served as marketplaces for both local and long-distance exchange; and they housed most manufacturing activity. Everywhere they generated a unique kind of society, compared to earlier agricultural villages or Paleolithic camps. Urban society was impersonal, for it was no longer possible to know everyone. Relationships of class and occupation emerged alongside those of kinship and village loyalty. Most notably, the degree of specialization and inequality far surpassed that of all preceding human communities.</p></div>
