</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0128"><p>Buddhism initially entered China via the Silk Road trading network during the first and second centuries <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> The stability and prosperity of the Han dynasty, then at its height, ensured that the new “barbarian” religion held little appeal for native Chinese. Furthermore, the Indian culture from which Buddhism sprang was at odds with Chinese understandings of the world in many ways. Buddhism’s commitment to a secluded and monastic life for monks and nuns seemed to dishonor Chinese family values, and its concern for individual salvation or enlightenment appeared selfish, contradicting the social orientation of Confucian thinking. Its abstract philosophy ran counter to the more concrete, “thi<span data-block_type="nobr">s-</span><wbr/>worldly” concerns of Chinese thinkers, and the Buddhist concept of infinite eons of time, endlessly repeating themselves, was quite a stretch for the Chinese, who normally thought in terms of finite family generations or dynastic cycles. No wonder that for the first several centuries <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, Buddhism was largely the preserve of foreign merchants and monks living in China.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0130"><p>What facilitated the rooting of Buddhism within China?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0131"><p>In the half millennium between roughly 300 and 800 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, however, Buddhism took solid root in China within both elite and popular culture, becoming a permanent, though fluctuating, presence in Chinese life. How did this remarkable transformation unfold? It began, arguably, with the collapse of the Han dynasty around 200 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> The chaotic, violent, and politically fragmented centuries that followed seriously discredited Confucianism and opened the door to alternative understandings of the world. Nomadic rulers, now governing much of northern China, found Buddhism useful in part because it was foreign. “We were born out of the marches,” declared one of them, “and though we are unworthy, we have complied with our appointed destiny and govern the Chinese as their prince…. Buddha being a barbarian god is the very one we should worship.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-011_30">30</span> Rulers and elite families provided patronage for Buddhist monasteries, temples, and works of art. In southern China, where many northern aristocrats had fled following the disastrous decline of the Han dynasty, Buddhism provided some comfort in the face of a collapsing society. Its emphasis on ritual, morality, and contemplation represented an intellectually and aesthetically satisfying response to times that were so clearly out of joint.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_351"><p>351</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0132"><p>Meanwhile, Buddhist monasteries increasingly provided an array of social services for ordinary people. In them, travelers found accommodation; those fleeing from China’s many upheavals discovered a place of refuge; desperate people received charity; farmers borrowed seed for the next planting; the sick were treated; and children learned to read. And for many, Buddhism was associated with access to magical powers as reports of miracles abounded. Battles were won, rain descended on drought-ridden areas, diseases were cured, and guilt was relieved — all through the magical ministrations of charismatic monks.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0133"><p>Accompanying all of this was a serious effort by monks, scholars, and translators to present this Indian religion in terms that Chinese could more readily grasp. Thus the Buddhist term <em>dharma</em>, referring to the Buddha’s teaching, was translated as <em>dao</em>, or “the way,” a notion long familiar in both Daoist and Confucian thinking (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch4_2.html">Chapter 4</span>). The Buddhist notion of “morality” was translated with the Confucian term that referred to “filial submission and obedience.” Some Indian concepts were modified in the process of translation. For example, the idea that “husband supports wife,” which reflected a considerable respect for women and mothers in early Indian Buddhism, became in translation “husband controls wife.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-011_31">31</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p035q"><p>You must know examples of changes to major religions as they spread through place and time, like this example of Pure Land Buddhism.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0134"><p>As Buddhism took hold in China, it was primarily in its broader Mahayana form — complete with numerous deities, the veneration of relics, many heavens and hells, and bodhisattvas to aid the believer — rather than its more psychological and individualistic Theravada form (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch4_2.html">Chapter 4</span>). One of the most popular expressions of Buddhism in China was the Pure Land School, in which faithfully repeating the name of an earlier Buddha, the Amitabha, was sufficient to ensure rebirth in a beautifully described heavenly realm, the Pure Land. In its emphasis on salvation by faith, without arduous study or intensive meditation, Pure Land Buddhism became a highly popular and authentically Chinese version of the Indian faith.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p0135"><p>China’s reunification under the Sui and early Tang dynasties witnessed growing state support for Buddhism. The Sui emperor Wendi (r. 581–604 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>) had monasteries constructed at the base of China’s five sacred mountains, further identifying the imported religion with traditional Chinese culture. He even used Buddhism to justify his military campaigns. “With a hundred victories in a hundred battles,” he declared, “we promote the practice of the ten Buddhist virtues.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch08-sec2-011_32">32</span> By 600 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.,</span> some 4,000 monasteries had been established. With state support and growing popular acceptance, they became centers of great wealth. They were largely exempt from taxation and owned large estates; ran businesses such as oil presses, water mills, and pawn shops; collected gems, gold, and lavish works of art; and employed millions of slaves, serfs, and other unfree and dependent workers. But Buddhism, while solidly entrenched in Chinese life by the early Tang dynasty, never achieved the independence from state authorities that the Christian Church acquired in Europe. The examinations for becoming a monk were supervised by the state, and education in the monasteries included the required study of the Confucian classics. In the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>ninth century, the state showed quite dramatically just how much control it could exercise over the Buddhist establishment.</p></div>
