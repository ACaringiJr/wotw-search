<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p097"><p>Not for long was the Industrial Revolution confined to Britain. It soon spread to continental Western Europe, and by the end of the nineteenth century it was well under way in the United States, Russia, and Japan. The globalization of industrialization had begun. Everywhere it took hold, industrialization bore a range of broadly similar outcomes. New technologies and sources of energy generated vast increases in production and spawned an unprecedented urbanization as well. Class structures changed as aristocrats, artisans, and peasants declined as classes, while the middle classes and a factory working class grew in numbers and social prominence. Middl<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>class women generally withdrew from paid labor altogether, and their workin<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>class counterparts sought to do so after marriage. Working women usually received lower wages than their male counterparts, had difficulty joining unions, and were accused of taking jobs from men. Workin<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>class frustration and anger gave rise to trade unions and socialist movements, injecting a new element of social conflict into industrial societies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p098"><p>Nevertheless, different histories, cultures, and societies ensured that the Industrial Revolution unfolded variously in the diverse countries in which it became established. Differences in the pace and timing of industrialization, the size and shape of major industries, the role of the state, the political expression of social conflict, and many other factors have made this process rich in comparative possibilities. French industrialization, for example, occurred more slowly and perhaps less disruptively than did that of Britain. Germany focused initially on heavy industry — iron, steel, and coal — rather than on the textile industry with which Britain had begun. Moreover, German industrialization was far more highly concentrated in huge companies called cartels, and it generated a rather more militant and Marxis<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>oriented labor movement than in Britain.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0110"><p>Nowhere were the variations in the industrializing process more apparent than in those two vast countries that lay on the periphery of Europe. To the west across the Atlantic Ocean was the United States, a young, vigorous, democratic, expanding country, populated largely by people of European descent, along with a substantial number of slaves of African origin. To the east was Russia, with its Eastern Orthodox Christianity, an autocratic tsar, a huge population of serfs, and an empire stretching across all of northern Asia. In the 1830s, the French observer Alexis de Tocqueville famously commented on these two emerging giants in his book <em>Democracy in America</em>:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0111"><p>The Anglo-American relies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends and gives free scope to the unguided strength and common sense of the people; the Russian centers all the authority of society in a single arm…. Their starting-point is different and their courses are not the same; yet each of them seems marked out by the will of Heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p0112"><p>By the early twentieth century, his prediction seemed to be coming true. Industrialization had turned the United States into a major global power and had spawned in Russia an enormous revolutionary upheaval that made that country the first outpost of global communism.</p></div>
