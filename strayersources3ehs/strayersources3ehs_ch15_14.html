<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p098"><p>While some Europeans were actively attempting to spread the Christian faith to distant corners of the world, others were nurturing an understanding of the cosmos at least partially at odds with traditional Christian teaching. These were the makers of Europe’s Scientific Revolution, a vast intellectual and cultural transformation that took place between the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>sixteenth and early eighteenth centuries. These men of science would no longer rely on the external authority of the Bible, the Church, the speculations of ancient philosophers, or the received wisdom of cultural tradition. For them, knowledge would be acquired through rational inquiry based on evidence, the product of human minds alone. Those who created this revolution — Copernicus from Poland, Galileo from Italy, Descartes from France, Newton from England, and many others — saw themselves as departing radically from older ways of thinking. “The old rubbish must be thrown away,” wrote a seventeent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century English scientist. “These are the days that must lay a new Foundation of a more magnificent Philosophy.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec1-003_13">13</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p099"><p>The long-term significance of the Scientific Revolution can hardly be overestimated. Within early modern Europe, it fundamentally altered ideas about the place of humankind within the cosmos and sharply challenged both the teachings and the authority of the Church. Over the past several centuries, it has substantially eroded religious belief and practice in the West, particularly among the well educated. When applied to the affairs of human society, scientific ways of thinking challenged ancient social hierarchies and political systems and played a role in the revolutionary upheavals of the modern era. But science was also used to legitimize racial and gender inequalities, giving new support to old ideas about the natural inferiority of women and enslaved people. When married to the technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution, science fostered both the marvels of modern production and the horrors of modern means of destruction. By the twentieth century, science had become so widespread that it largely lost its association with European culture and became the chief marker of global modernity. Like Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, modern science became a universal worldview, open to all who could accept its premises and its techniques.</p></div>
