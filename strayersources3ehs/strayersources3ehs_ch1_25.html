<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0137"><p>In other places, agricultural village societies came to be organized politically as chiefdoms, in which inherited positions of power and privilege introduced a more distinct element of inequality, but unlike later kings, chiefs could seldom use force to compel the obedience of their subjects. Instead, chiefs relied on their generosity or gift giving, their ritual status, or their personal charisma to persuade their followers. The earliest such chiefdoms seem to have emerged in the Tigri<span data-block_type="nobr">s-</span><wbr/>Euphrates river valley called Mesopotamia (presen<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>day Iraq), sometime after 6000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, when temple priests may have organized irrigation systems and controlled trade with nearby societies.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0138"><p>Many chiefdoms followed in all parts of the world, and the more recent ones have been much studied by anthropologists. For example, chiefdoms emerged everywhere in the Pacific islands, which had been colonized by agricultural Polynesian peoples. Chiefs usually derived from a senior lineage, tracing their descent to the first son of an imagined ancestor. With both religious and secular functions, chiefs led important rituals and ceremonies, organized the community for warfare, directed its economic life, and sought to resolve internal conflicts. They collected tribute from commoners in the form of food, manufactured goods, and raw materials. These items in turn were redistributed to warriors, craftsmen, religious specialists, and other subordinates, while chiefs kept enough to maintain their prestigious positions and imposing lifestyle. In North America as well, a remarkable series of chiefdoms emerged in the eastern woodlands, where an extensive array of large earthen mounds testify to the organizational capacity of these early societies. The largest of them, known as Cahokia, flourished around 1100 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0139"><p>Thus the Agricultural Revolution radically transformed both the trajectory of the human journey and the evolution of life on the planet. This epic process granted to one species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, a growing power over many other species of plants and animals and made possible an increase in human numbers far beyond what a gathering and hunting economy could support.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_46"><p>46</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0140"><p>But if agriculture provided humankind with the power to dominate nature, it also, increasingly, enabled some people to dominate others. This was not immediately apparent, and for several thousand years, and much longer in some places, agricultural villages and pastoral communities retained elements of the social equality that had characterized Paleolithic life. Slowly, though, many of the resources released by the Agricultural Revolution accumulated in the hands of a few. Rich and poor, chiefs and commoners, landowners and dependent peasants, rulers and subjects, dominant men and subordinate women, slaves and free people — these distinctions, so common in the record of world history, took shape most extensively in highly productive agricultural settings, which generated a substantial economic surplus. There the endless elaboration of such differences, for better or worse, became a major feature of those distinctive agricultural societies known to us as “civilizations.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0141"><p>The distinctions that historians make among various kinds of human communities — gathering and hunting peoples, pastoral societies, agricultural village communities, chiefdoms, civilizations — do not represent hard-and-fast differences, but lie on a continuum. Many gathering and hunting societies were nomadic, but some became sedentary; many agricultural and pastoral peoples continued to enrich their diets with foods hunted, gathered, or fished; the line between chiefdoms and civilizations is not always obvious. Such terms are useful for identifying variations in human history, but lived experience is usually messier and less clear than our tidy concepts.</p></div>
