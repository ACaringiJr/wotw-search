</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p071"><p>For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life “was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-006_21">21</span> Such efforts took many forms. By 1815, about 1 million workers, mostly artisans, had created a variety of “friendly societies.” With dues contributed by members, these workin<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>class sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>help groups provided insurance against sickness, a decent funeral, and an opportunity for social life in an otherwis<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>bleak environment. Other skilled artisans, who had been displaced by machin<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>produced goods and forbidden to organize in legal unions, sometimes wrecked the offending machinery and burned the mills that had taken their jobs. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch17_15.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: The English Luddites and Machine Breaking</span>.) The class consciousness of working people was such that one police informer reported that “most every creature of the lower order both in town and country are on their side.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-006_22">22</span> Others acted within the political arena by joining movements aimed at obtaining the vote for workin<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>class men, a goal that was gradually achieved in the second half of the nineteenth century. When trade unions were legalized in 1824, growing numbers of factory workers joined these associations in their efforts to achieve better wages and working conditions. Initially their strikes, attempts at nationwide organization, and threat of violence made them fearful indeed to the upper classes. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as “the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country,”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-006_23">23</span> although they later became rather more “respectable” organizations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p072"><p>Socialist ideas of various kinds gradually spread within the working class, challenging the assumptions of a capitalist society. Robert Owen (1771–1858), a wealthy British cotton textile manufacturer, urged the creation of small industrial communities where workers and their families would be well treated. He established one such community, with a te<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>hour workday, spacious housing, decent wages, and education for children, at his mill in New Lanark in Scotland.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p073"><p>Of more lasting significance was the socialism of Karl Marx (1818–1883). German by birth, Marx spent much of his life in England, where he witnessed the brutal conditions of Britain’s Industrial Revolution and wrote voluminously about history and economics. His probing analysis led him to the conclusion that industrial capitalism was an inherently unstable system, doomed to collapse in a revolutionary upheaval that would give birth to a classless socialist society, thus ending forever the ancient conflict between rich and poor. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidence" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence</span>, for the various voices of a socialist tradition inspired by Marx.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p083"><p>In his writings, the combined impact of Europe’s industrial, political, and scientific revolutions found expression. Industrialization created both the social conditions against which Marx protested so bitterly and the enormous wealth he felt would make socialism possible. The French Revolution, still a living memory in Marx’s youth, provided evidence that grand upheavals, giving rise to new societies, had in fact taken place and could do so again. Moreover, Marx regarded himself as a scientist, discovering the laws of social development in much the same fashion as Newton discovered the laws of motion. His was therefore a “scientific socialism,” embedded in these laws of historical change; revolution was a certainty and the socialist future was inevitable.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p086"><p>It was a grand, compelling, prophetic, utopian vision of human freedom and community — and it inspired socialist movements of workers and intellectuals amid the grim harshness of Europe’s industrialization in the second half of the nineteenth century. Socialists established political parties in most European states and linked them together in international organizations as well. These parties recruited members, contested elections as they gained the right to vote, agitated for reforms, and in some cases plotted revolution.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p087"><p>In the later decades of the nineteenth century, such ideas echoed among more radical trade unionists and some middle-class intellectuals in Britain, and even more so in a rapidly industrializing Germany and elsewhere. By then, however, the British working-class movement was not overtly revolutionary. When a working-class political party, the Labour Party, was established in the 1890s, it advocated a reformist program and a peaceful democratic transition to socialism, largely rejecting the class struggle and revolutionary emphasis of classical Marxism. Generally known as “social democracy,” this approach to socialism was especially prominent in Germany during the late nineteenth century and spread more widely in the twentieth century when it came into conflict with the more violent and revolutionary movements calling themselves “communist.”</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p035m"><p>Take notes on how governments in Western Europe responded to Marx’s ideas.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p088"><p>Improving material conditions during the second half of the nineteenth century helped move the working-class movement in Britain, Germany, and elsewhere away from a revolutionary posture. Marx had expected industrial capitalist societies to polarize into a small wealthy class and a huge and increasingly impoverished proletariat. However, standing between “the captains of industry” and the workers was a sizable middle and lower middle class, constituting perhaps 30 percent of the population, most of whom were not really wealthy but were immensely proud that they were not manual laborers. Marx had not foreseen the development of this intermediate social group, nor had he imagined that workers could better their standard of living within a capitalist framework. But they did. Wages rose under pressure from unions; cheap imported food improved working-class diets; infant mortality rates fell; and shops and chain stores catering to working-class families multiplied. As English male workers gradually obtained the right to vote, politicians had an incentive to legislate in their favor, by abolishing child labor, regulating factory conditions, and even, in 1911, inaugurating a system of relief for the unemployed. Sanitary reform considerably cleaned up the “filth and stink” of early nineteenth-century cities, and urban parks made a modest appearance. Contrary to Marx’s expectations, capitalist societies demonstrated some capacity for reform.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p089"><p>Further eroding working-class radicalism was a growing sense of nationalism, which bound workers in particular countries to their middle-class employers and compatriots, offsetting to some extent the economic and social antagonism between them. When World War I broke out, the “workers of the world,” far from uniting against their bourgeois enemies as Marx had urged them, instead set off to slaughter one another in enormous numbers on the battlefields of Europe. National loyalty had trumped class loyalty.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_755"><p>755</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p090"><p>Nonetheless, as the twentieth century dawned, industrial Britain was hardly a stable or contented society. Immense inequalities still separated the classes. Some 40 percent of the working class continued to live in conditions then described as “poverty.” A mounting wave of strikes from 1910 to 1913 testified to the intensity of class conflict. The Labour Party was becoming a major force in Parliament. Some socialists and some feminists were becoming radicalized. “Wisps of violence hung in the English air,” wrote Eric Hobsbawm, “symptoms of a crisis in economy and society, which the [country’s] self-confident opulence … could not quite conceal.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch17-sec2-006_25">25</span> The world’s first industrial society remained dissatisfied and conflicted.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch17-p091"><p>It was also a society in economic decline relative to industrial newcomers such as Germany and the United States. Britain paid a price for its early lead, for its businessmen became committed to machinery that became obsolete as the century progressed. Latecomers invested in more modern equipment and in various ways had surpassed the British by the early twentieth century.</p></div>
