Among them, Moche (MO<span data-block_type="nobr">H-</span><wbr/>chee) civilization clearly stands out. Dominating a 25<span data-block_type="nobr">0-</span><wbr/>mile stretch of Peru’s northern coast and incorporating thirteen river valleys, the Moche people flourished between about 100 and 800 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> Their economy was rooted in a complex irrigation system, requiring constant maintenance, which funneled runoff from the Andes into fields of maize, beans, and squash and acres of cotton, all fertilized by rich bird droppings called guano. Moche fishermen also harvested millions of anchovies from the bountiful Pacific.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0100"><p>What features of Moche life characterize it as a civilization?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p098"><p>Politically, Moche was governed by warrio<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>priests, some of whom lived atop huge pyramids, the largest of which was constructed from 143 million su<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>dried bricks. There shama<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>rulers, often under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, conducted ancient rituals that mediated between the world of humankind and that of the gods. They also presided over the ritual sacrifice of human victims, drawn from their many prisoners of war, which became central to the politic<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>religious life of the Moche. Images on Moche pottery show a ruler attired in a magnificent feather headdress and seated on a pyramid, while a parade of naked prisoners marches past him. Other scenes of decapitation and dismemberment indicate the fate that awaited those destined for sacrifice. For these rulers, the Moche world was apparently one of war, ceremony, and diplomacy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0101"><p>The immense wealth of this warrio<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>priest elite and the exquisite artistry of Moche craftsmen are reflected in the elaborate burials accorded the rulers. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch6_18.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: The Lord of Sipan and the Lady of Cao</span>.) In the absence of written texts, these artistic products are the most accessible aspect of Moche life, and much of what scholars know about the Moche world derives from the superb skill of its craftspeople, such as metalworkers, potters, weavers, and painters. Face masks, figures of animals, small earrings, and other jewelry items, many plated in gold, display amazing technical abilities and a striking artistic sensibility. Decorating Moche ceramic pottery are naturalistic portraits of noble lords and rulers and images from the life of common people, including the blind and the sick. Battle scenes show warriors confronting their enemies with raised clubs. Erotic encounters between men and women and gods making love to humans likewise represent common themes, as do grotesque images of the many Moche gods and goddesses. Much of this, of course, reflects the culture of the Moche elite. We know much less about the daily life of the farmers, fishermen, weavers, traders, construction workers, and servants whose labor made that elite culture possible.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0102"><p>These cultural achievements, however, rested on fragile environmental foundations, for the region was subject to drought, earthquakes, and occasional torrential rains associated with El Niño episodes (dramatic changes in weather patterns caused by periodic warming of Pacific Ocean currents). During the sixth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, some combination of these forces caused extended ecological disruption, which seriously undermined Moche civilization. In these circumstances, the Moche were vulnerable to aggressive neighbors and possibly to internal social tensions as well. By the end of the eighth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, that civilization had passed into history.</p></div>
