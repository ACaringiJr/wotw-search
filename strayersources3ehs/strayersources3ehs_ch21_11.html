<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p080"><p>What were the achievements of communist efforts at industrialization? What problems did these achievements generate?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p078"><p>When the Chinese communists began their active industrialization efforts in the early 1950s, they largely followed the model pioneered by the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and the 1930s. That model involved state ownership of property, centralized planning embodied in successive five-year plans, priority to heavy industry, massive mobilization of the nation’s human and material resources, and intrusive Communist Party control of the entire process. Both countries experienced major — indeed unprecedented — economic growth. The Soviet Union constructed the foundations of an industrial society in the 1930s that proved itself in the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II and that by the 1960s and 1970s had generated substantially improved standards of living. China also quickly expanded its output. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_china_under_mao__1949___1976.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot: China under Mao</span>). In addition, both countries achieved massive improvements in their literacy rates and educational opportunities, allowing far greater social mobility for millions of people than ever before. In both countries, industrialization fostered a similar set of social outcomes: rapid urbanization, exploitation of the countryside to provide resources for modern industry in the cities, and the growth of a privileged bureaucratic and technological elite intent on pursuing their own careers and passing on their new status to their children.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p081"><p>Perhaps the chief difference in the industrial histories of the Soviet Union and China lies in the leadership’s response to these social outcomes. In the Soviet Union under Stalin and his successors, they were largely accepted. Industrialization was centered in large urban areas, which pulled from the countryside the most ambitious and talented people. A highly privileged group of state and party leaders emerged in the Stalin era and largely remained the unchallenged ruling class of the country until the 1980s. Even in the 1930s, the outlines of a conservative society, which had discarded much of its revolutionary legacy, were apparent. Stalin himself endorsed Russian patriotism, traditional family values, individual competition, and substantial differences in wages to stimulate production, as an earlier commitment to egalitarianism was substantially abandoned. Increasingly the invocation of revolutionary values was devoid of real content, and by the 1970s the perception of official hypocrisy was widespread.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p084"><p>The unique feature of Chinese history under Mao Zedong’s leadership was a recurrent effort to combat these perhaps inevitable tendencies of any industrializing process and to revive and preserve the revolutionary spirit, which had animated the Communist Party during its long struggle for power. By the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>1950s, Mao and some of his followers had become persuaded that the Soviet model of industrialization was leading China away from socialism and toward new forms of inequality, toward individualistic and careerist values, and toward an urban bias that privileged the cities at the expense of the countryside. The Great Leap Forward of 1958–1960 marked Mao’s first response to these distortions of Chinese socialism. It promoted smal<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>scale industrialization in the rural areas rather than focusing wholly on large enterprises in the cities; it tried to foster widespread and practical technological education for all rather than relying on a small elite of highly trained technical experts; and it envisaged an immediate transition to full communism in the “people’s communes” rather than waiting for industrial development to provide the material basis for that transition. The massive famine that followed temporarily discredited Mao’s radicalism.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_945"><p>945</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p085"><p>Nonetheless, in the mid-1960s Mao launched yet another campaign — the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution — to combat the capitalist tendencies that he believed had penetrated even the highest ranks of the Communist Party itself. The Cultural Revolution also involved new policies to bring health care and education to the countryside and to reinvigorate earlier efforts at rural industrialization under local rather than central control. In these ways, Mao struggled, though without great success, to overcome the inequalities associated with China’s modern development and to create a model of socialist modernity quite distinct from that of the Soviet Union.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p086"><p>The Cultural Revolution also rejected feminism, any specific concern with women’s issues, and much that was feminine. A popular slogan stated: “The times have changed; men and women are the same.” Yet the supposedly gender-neutral model seemed strikingly masculine. Women cut their hair short, wore army clothes, and learned to curse; they were depicted in propaganda posters as “iron girls,” strong, muscular, and performing heavy traditionally male work. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource213" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 21.3</span>.) Art, literature, ballet, and opera cast them as militant revolutionary participants. And yet, factory managers continued to prefer women workers because of their alleged patience and manual dexterity. Young women sent to the countryside to work with peasants found themselves subject to sexual abuse by male officials. Thus strenuous Maoist efforts to eliminate differences between classes, between urban and rural life, and between men and women largely failed.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p087"><p>A final commonality among communist industrializers lay in their great confidence in both human rationality and the centralized planning embodied in huge projects — enormous factories, large collective farms, gigantic dams. Soviet officials saw the environment as an enemy, spoke about “the struggle against nature,” and looked forward to “a profound rearrangement of the entire living world.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch21-sec2-005_6">6</span> This attitude, no less than capitalist assumptions, led to immense environmental devastation and a very difficult legacy for postcommunist regimes. In the Soviet Union, for example, huge industrial complexes such as Magnitogorsk concentrated air and water pollution. A scheme to bring millions of acres of semi-arid land under cultivation in Central Asia depleted and eroded the fragile soil. Diverting the waters of several rivers feeding the Aral Sea for irrigating cotton fields reduced the size of that huge inland sea by 90 percent. By the late 1980s, such environmental heedlessness meant that about half of the cultivated land in the country was endangered by erosion, salinization, or swamping; some 30 percent of food products were contaminated by pesticides or herbicides; 75 percent of the surface water was severely polluted; and 70 million people lived in cities with air pollution five or more times the acceptable level.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch21-sec2-005_7">7</span> But nothing brought Soviet environmental problems to public attention more dramatically than the explosion of a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in 1986. It scattered highly radioactive material over parts of Ukraine and Belorussia, while the cloud from the explosion swept across parts of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, terrifying millions even much farther away.</p></div>
