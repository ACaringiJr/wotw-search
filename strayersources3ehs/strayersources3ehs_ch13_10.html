<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p035i"><p>Make a chart of similarities and differences between European colonial rule in the Caribbean and North America and European colonial rule in South America.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p060"><p>What the Europeans had encountered across the Atlantic was another “old world,” but their actions surely gave rise to a “new world” in the Americas. Their colonial empires — Spanish, Portuguese, British, and French alike — did not simply conquer and govern established societies, but rather generated wholly new societies, born of the decimation of Native American populations and the introduction of European and African peoples, cultures, plants, and animals.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p061"><p>Furthermore, all the European rulers of these empires viewed their realms through the lens of the prevailing economic theory known as mercantilism. This view held that European governments served their countries’ economic interests best by encouraging exports and accumulating bullion (precious metals such as silver and gold), believed to be the source of national prosperity. In this scheme of things, colonies provided closed markets for the manufactured goods of the “mother country” and, if they were lucky, supplied great quantities of bullion as well. Mercantilist thinking thus fueled European wars and colonial rivalries around the world in the early modern era. Particularly in Spanish America, however, it was a theory largely ignored or evaded in practice. Spain had few manufactured goods to sell, and piracy and smuggling allowed Spanish colonists to exchange goods with Spain’s rivals.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_564"><p>564</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p062"><p>But variations across the immense colonial world of the Western Hemisphere were at least as noticeable as these similarities. Some differences grew out of the societies of the colonizing power, such as the contrast between a semi-feudal and Catholic Spain and a more rapidly changing Protestant England. The kind of economy established in particular regions — settler-dominated agriculture, slave-based plantations, ranching, or mining — likewise influenced their development. So too did the character of the Native American cultures — the more densely populated and urbanized Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations differed greatly from the more sparsely populated rural villages of North America, for example.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p063"><p>Furthermore, women and men often experienced colonial intrusion in quite distinct ways. Beyond the common burdens of violent conquest, epidemic disease, and coerced labor, both Native American and enslaved African women had to cope with the additional demands made on them as females. Conquest was often accompanied by the transfer of women to the new colonial rulers. Cortés, for example, marked his alliance with the city of Tlaxcala (tlah-SKAH-lah) against the Aztecs by an exchange of gifts in which he received hundreds of female slaves and eight daughters of elite Tlaxcalan families, whom he distributed to his soldiers. And he commanded the Aztec ruler: “You are to deliver women with light skins, corn, chicken, eggs, and tortillas.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec1-002_12">12</span></p></div>

<h3 data-type="title" data-for_type="box" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-ch13-bx1-001j">AP® EXAM TIP</h3>
<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p035j"><p>Remember these examples of how Amerindian women were treated by both native men and Europeans after European conquest.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p064"><p>Soon after conquest, many Spanish men married elite native women. It was a long-standing practice in Amerindian societies and was encouraged by both Spanish and indigenous male authorities as a means of cementing their new relationship. It was also advantageous for some of the women involved. One of Aztec emperor Moctezuma’s daughters, who was mistress to Cortés and eventually married several other Spaniards, wound up with the largest landed estate in the valley of Mexico. Below this elite level of interaction, however, far more women experienced sexual violence and abuse. Rape accompanied conquest in many places, and dependent or enslaved women working under the control of European men frequently found themselves required to perform sexual services. This was tragedy and humiliation for native and enslaved men as well, for they were unable to protect their women from such abuse. Such variations in culture, policy, economy, and gender generated quite different colonial societies in several major regions of the Americas.</p></div>
