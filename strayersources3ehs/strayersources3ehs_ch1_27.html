<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-ch01-sec1-006">REFLECTIONS: The Uses of the Paleolithic
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0144"><p>Even when it is about the distant past, history is also about those who tell it in the present. We search the past, always, for our own purposes. For example, modern people were long inclined to view their Paleolithic or gathering and hunting ancestors as primitive or superstitious, unable to exercise control over nature, and ignorant of its workings. Such a view was, of course, a kind of sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>congratulation, designed to highlight the “progress” of modern humankind. It was a way of saying, “Look how far we have come.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0145"><p>In more recent decades, however, growing numbers of people, disillusioned with modernity, have looked to the Paleolithic era for material with which to criticize, rather than celebrate, contemporary life. Feminists have found in gathering and hunting peoples a much more gende<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>equal society and religious thinking that featured the divine feminine, qualities that encouragingly suggested that patriarchy was neither inevitable nor eternal. Environmentalists have sometimes identified peoples in the distant past who were uniquely in tune with the natural environment rather than seeking to dominate it. Some nutritionists have advocated a “Paleolithic diet” of wild plants and animals as well suited to our physiology. Critics of modern materialism and competitive capitalism have been delighted to discover societies in which values of sharing and equality predominated over those of accumulation and hierarchy. Still others have asked, in light of the long Paleolithic era, whether the explosive population and economic growth of recent centuries should be considered normal or natural. Perhaps they are better seen as extraordinary, possibly even pathological. All of these uses of the Paleolithic have been a way of asking, “What have we lost in the mad rush to modernity, and how can we recover it?”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_47"><p>47</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch01-p0146"><p>Both those who look with disdain on Paleolithic “backwardness” and those who praise, often quite romantically, its simplicity and equality seek to use these ancient people for their own purposes. In our efforts to puzzle out the past, all of us — historians and students of history very much included — stand somewhere. None of us can be entirely detached when we view the past, but this is not necessarily a matter for regret. What we may lose in objectivity, we gain in passionate involvement with the historical record and with the many men and women who have inhabited it. Despite its remoteness from us in time and manner of living, the Paleolithic era resonates still in the twenty-first century, reminding us of our kinship with these distant people and the significance of that kinship to finding our own way in a very different world.</p></div>
