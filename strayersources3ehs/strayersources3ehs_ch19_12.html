</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p088"><p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, both China and the Ottoman Empire, recently centers of proud and vibrant civilizations, had experienced the consequences of a rapidly shifting balance of global power. Now they were “sem<span data-block_type="nobr">i-</span><wbr/>colonies” within the “informal empires” of Europe, although they retained sufficient independence for their governments to launch catc<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>up efforts of defensive modernization, the Ottomans earlier and the Chinese later. But neither was able to create the industrial economies or strong states required to fend off European intrusion and restore their former status in the world. Despite their diminished power, however, both China and the Ottoman Empire gave rise to new nationalist conceptions of society, which were initially small and limited in appeal but of great significance for the future.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p089"><p>In the early twentieth century, that future witnessed the end of both the Chinese and Ottoman empires. In China, the collapse of the imperial system in 1912 was followed by a vast revolutionary upheaval that by 1949 led to a communist regime within largely the same territorial space as the old empire. By contrast, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire following World War I led to the creation of the new but much smaller natio<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>state of Turkey in the Anatolian heartland of the old empire, which lost its vast Arab and European provinces.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_850"><p>850</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p0100"><p>China’s twentieth-century revolutionaries rejected traditional Confucian culture far more thoroughly than the secularizing leaders of modern Turkey rejected Islam. Almost everywhere in the Islamic world, including Turkey, traditional religion retained its hold on the private loyalties of most people and later in the twentieth century became a basis for social renewal in many places. Islamic civilization, unlike its Chinese counterpart, had many independent centers and was never so closely associated with a single state. Furthermore, it was embedded in a deeply religious tradition that was personally meaningful to millions of adherents, in contrast to the more elitist and secular outlook of Confucianism. Many rural Chinese, however, retained traditional Confucian values such as filial piety, and Confucianism has made something of a comeback in China over the past several decades. Nonetheless, Islam retained a hold on its civilization in the twentieth century rather more firmly than Confucianism did in China.</p></div>
