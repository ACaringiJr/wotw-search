<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p076"><p>Another and quite different kind of colonial society emerged in the lowland areas of Brazil, ruled by Portugal, and in the Spanish, British, French, and Dutch colonies in the Caribbean. These regions lacked the great civilizations of Mexico and Peru. Nor did they provide much mineral wealth until the Brazilian gold rush of the 1690s and the discovery of diamonds a little later. Still, Europeans found a very profitable substitute in sugar, which was much in demand in Europe, where it was used as a medicine, a spice, a sweetener, a preservative, and in sculptured forms as a decoration that indicated high status. Although commercial agriculture in the Spanish Empire served a domestic market in its towns and mining camps, these suga<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>based colonies produced almost exclusively for export, while importing their food and other necessities.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p077"><p>Large-scale sugar production had been pioneered by Arabs, who had introduced it in the Mediterranean. Europeans learned the technique and transferred it to their Atlantic island possessions and then to the Americas. For a century (1570–1670), Portuguese planters along the northeast coast of Brazil dominated the world market for sugar. Then the British, French, and Dutch turned their Caribbean territories into highly productive sugar-producing colonies, breaking the Portuguese and Brazilian monopoly.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p080"><p>Sugar decisively transformed Brazil and the Caribbean. Its production, which involved both growing the sugarcane and processing it into usable sugar, was very labo<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>intensive and could most profitably occur in a larg<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>scale, almost industrial setting. It was perhaps the first modern industry in that it produced for an international and mass market, using capital and expertise from Europe, with production facilities located in the Americas. However, its most characteristic feature — the massive use of slave labor — was an ancient practice. In the absence of a Native American population, which had been almost totally wiped out in the Caribbean or had fled inland in Brazil, European sugarcane planters turned to Africa and the Atlantic slave trade for an alternative workforce. The vast majority of the African captives transported across the Atlantic, some 80 percent or more, ended up in Brazil and the Caribbean. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch14_2.html">Chapter 14</span> for a more extensive description of the Atlantic slave trade.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p081"><p>Slaves worked on suga<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>producing estates in horrendous conditions. The heat and fire from the cauldrons, which turned raw sugarcane into crystallized sugar, reminded many visitors of scenes from Hell. These conditions, combined with disease, generated a high death rate, perhaps 5 to 10 percent per year, which required plantation owners to constantly import fresh slaves. A Jesuit observer in 1580 aptly summarized the situation: “The work is great and many die.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-005_16">16</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p035p"><p>You must know demographic features and effects of African slavery in the Americas and in Africa.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p082"><p>More male slaves than female slaves were imported from Africa into the sugar economies of the Americas, leading to major and persistent gender imbalances. Nonetheless, female slaves did play distinctive roles in these societies. Women made up about half of the field gangs that did the heavy work of planting and harvesting sugarcane. They were subject to the same brutal punishments and received the same rations as their male counterparts, though they were seldom permitted to undertake the more skilled labor inside the sugar mills. Women who worked in urban areas, mostly for white female owners, did domestic chores and were often hired out as laborers in various homes, shops, laundries, inns, and brothels. Discouraged from establishing stable families, women had to endure, often alone, the wrenching separation from their children that occurred when they were sold. Mary Prince, a Caribbean slave who wrote a brief account of her life, recalled the pain of families torn apart: “The great God above alone knows the thoughts of the poor slave’s heart, and the bitter pains which follow such separations as these. All that we love taken away from us — oh, it is sad, sad! and sore to be borne!”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-005_17">17</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p083"><p>The extensive use of African slave labor gave these plantation colonies a very different ethnic and racial makeup than that of highland Spanish America, as the <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_ethnic_composition_of_colonial_societies_in_latin_america.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot</span> indicates. Thus, after three centuries of colonial rule, a substantial majority of Brazil’s population was either partially or wholly of African descent. In the French Caribbean colony of Haiti in 1790, the corresponding figure was 93 percent.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p084"><p>As in Spanish America, a considerable amount of racial mixing took place in Brazil. Cros<span data-block_type="nobr">s-</span><wbr/>racial unions accounted for only about 10 percent of all marriages in Brazil, but the use of concubines and informal liaisons among Indians, Africans, and Portuguese produced a substantial mixe<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>race population. From their ranks derived much of the urban skilled workforce and many of the supervisors in the sugar industry. <em>Mulattoes</em>, the product of Portugues<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>African unions, predominated, but as many as forty separate and named groups, each indicating a different racial mixture, emerged in colonial Brazil.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p085"><p>The plantation complex of the Americas, based on African slavery, extended beyond the Caribbean and Brazil to encompass the southern colonies of British North America, where tobacco, cotton, rice, and indigo were major crops, but the social outcomes of these plantation colonies were quite different from those farther south. Because European women had joined the colonial migration to North America at an early date, these colonies experienced less racial mixing and certainly demonstrated less willingness to recognize the offspring of such unions and accord them a place in society. A sharply defined racial system (with black Africans, “red” Native Americans, and white Europeans) evolved in North America, whereas both Portuguese and Spanish colonies acknowledged a wide variety of mixe<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>race groups.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p087"><p>Slavery too was different in North America than in the sugar colonies. By 1750 or so, slaves in what became the United States proved able to reproduce themselves, and by the time of the Civil War almost all North American slaves had been born in the New World. That was never the case in Latin America, where large-scale importation of new slaves continued well into the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, many more slaves were voluntarily set free by their owners in Brazil than in North America, and free blacks and mulattoes in Brazil had more economic opportunities than did their counterparts in the United States. At least a few among them found positions as political leaders, scholars, musicians, writers, and artists. Some were even hired as slave catchers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p088"><p>Does this mean, then, that racism was absent in colonial Brazil? Certainly not, but it was different from racism in North America. For one thing, in North America, any African ancestry, no matter how small or distant, made a person “black”; in Brazil, a person of African and non-African ancestry was considered not black, but some other mixed-race category. Racial prejudice surely persisted, for white characteristics were prized more highly than black features, and people regarded as white had enormously greater privileges and opportunities than others. Nevertheless, skin color in Brazil, and in Latin America generally, was only one criterion of class status, and the perception of color changed with the educational or economic standing of individuals. A light-skinned mulatto who had acquired some wealth or education might well pass as a white. One curious visitor to Brazil was surprised to find a darker-skinned man serving as a local official. “Isn’t the governor a mulatto?” inquired the visitor. “He was, but he isn’t any more,” was the reply. “How can a governor be a mulatto?”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-005_19">19</span></p></div>
