<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0102"><p>The pace of change in this emerging civilization picked up considerably in the several centuries after 1000. For many centuries before this, the world of European Christendom had been subject to repeated invasions. The incursion of Germanic peoples had accompanied the decline and fall of the western Roman Empire. In the fifth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, the Central Asian Huns had penetrated as far as France and briefly, under the leadership of Attila, established a large state across much of Central and Eastern Europe. Muslim armies had conquered Christian North Africa and Spain and threatened the rest of Europe. In the ninth and tenth centuries, Magyar (Hungarian) invasions from the east and Viking incursions from the north likewise disrupted and threatened pos<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>Roman Europe (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch10/STR_02272_10_M03.html" data-target="_pop">Map 10.3</span>). But by the year 1000, these invasions had been checked; the invaders had been absorbed into settled society and in some cases had converted to Christianity. The greater security and stability that came with relative peace arguably opened the way to an accelerating tempo of change. The climate also seemed to cooperate. A generally warming trend after 750 reached its peak in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, enhancing agricultural production, especially in northern and highland regions.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0103"><p>Whatever may have launched this new phase of European civilization, commonly called the High Middle Ages (1000–1300), the signs of expansion and growth were widely evident. The population of Europe grew from perhaps 35 million in 1000 to about 80 million in 1340. With more people, many new lands were opened for cultivation in a process paralleling China’s expansion to the south at the same time. Great lords, bishops, and religious orders organized new villages on what had recently been forest or wasteland. Marshes were drained in many regions, and land was reclaimed from the sea, especially along the North Sea coast.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_430"><p>430</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0106"><p>Warmer weather during the summer months allowed farmers and pastoralists to herd their flocks into previously wild highland regions. Everywhere trees were felled at tremendous rates to clear agricultural land and to use as fuel or building material. By 1300, the forest cover of Europe had been reduced to about 20 percent of the land area. “I believe that the forest … covers the land to no purpose,” declared a German abbot, “and hold this to be an unbearable harm.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-009_17">17</span> These developments took a heavy toll on both the terrestrial and aquatic environments. Deforestation, overfishing, human waste, and the proliferation of new watermills and their associated ponds damaged freshwater ecosystems in many places. Lamenting the declining availability of fish, the French king Philip IV declared in 1289: “Today each and every river and waterside of our realm, large and small, yields nothing.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-009_18">18</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0107"><p>The increased production associated with this agricultural expansion stimulated a considerable growth in long-distance trade, much of which had dried up in the aftermath of the Roman collapse. One center of commercial activity lay in Northern Europe from England to the Baltic coast and involved the exchange of wood, beeswax, furs, rye, wheat, salt, cloth, and wine. The other major trading network centered on northern Italian towns such as Florence, Genoa, and Venice. Their trading partners were the more established civilizations of Islam and Byzantium, and the primary objects of trade included silks, drugs, precious stones, and spices from Asia. At great trading fairs, particularly those in the Champagne area of France near Paris, merchants from Northern and Southern Europe met to exchange the products of their respective areas, such as northern woolens for Mediterranean spices. Thus the self-sufficient communities of earlier centuries increasingly forged commercial bonds among themselves and with more distant peoples.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0108"><p>The population of towns and cities likewise grew on the sites of older Roman towns, at trading crossroads and fortifications, and around cathedrals all over Europe. Some towns had only a few hundred people, but others became much larger. In the early 1300s, London had about 40,000 people, Paris had approximately 80,000, and Venice by the end of the fourteenth century could boast perhaps 150,000. To keep these figures in perspective, Constantinople housed some 400,000 people in 1000, Córdoba in Muslim Spain about 500,000, the Song dynasty capital of Hangzhou more than 1 million in the thirteenth century, and the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán perhaps 200,000 by 1500. Nonetheless, urbanization was proceeding apace in Europe, though never hosting more than 10 percent of Europe’s population. These towns gave rise to and attracted new groups of people, particularly merchants, bankers, artisans, and university-trained professionals such as lawyers, doctors, and scholars. Many of these groups, including university professors and students, organized themselves into guilds (associations of people pursuing the same line of work) to regulate their respective professions. Thus, from the rural social order of lord and peasant, a new more productive and complex division of labor took shape in European society.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0109"><p>A further sign of accelerating change in the West lay in the growth of territorial states with more effective institutions of government commanding the loyalty, or at least the obedience, of their subjects. Since the disintegration of the Roman Empire, Europeans’ loyalties had focused on the family, the manor, or the religious community, but seldom on the state. Great lords may have been recognized as kings, but their authority was extremely limited and was exercised through a complex and decentralized network of feudal relationships with earls, counts, barons, and knights, who often felt little obligation to do the king’s bidding. But in the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries, the nominal monarchs of Europe gradually and painfully began to consolidate their authority, and the outlines of French, English, Spanish, Scandinavian, and other states began to appear, each with its own distinct language and culture (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch10/STR_02272_10_M03.html" data-target="_pop">Map 10.3</span>). Royal courts and fledgling bureaucracies were established, and groups of professional administrators appeared. Such territorial kingdoms were not universal, however. In Italy, cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states flourished as urban areas grew wealthy and powerful, whereas the Germans remained divided among a large number of small principalities within the Holy Roman Empire.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0110"><p>These changes, which together represented the making of a new civilization, had implications for the lives of countless women and men. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch10_17.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Cecilia Penifader, for an account of a rural unmarried woman’s life in England during this time</span>.) Economic growth and urbanization initially offered European women substantial new opportunities. Women were active in a number of urban professions, such as weaving, brewing, milling grain, midwifery, smal<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>scale retailing, laundering, spinning, and prostitution. In twelft<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century Paris, for example, a list of 100 occupations identified 86 as involving women workers, of which 6 were exclusively female. In England, women worked as silk weavers, hatmakers, tailors, brewers, and leather processors and were entitled to train female apprentices in some of these trades. In Frankfurt, about on<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>third of the crafts and trades were entirely female, another 40 percent were dominated by men, and the rest were open to both. Widows of great merchants sometimes continued their husbands’ businesses, and one of them, Rose Burford, lent a large sum of money to the king of England to finance a war against Scotland in 1318.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0111"><p>Much as economic and technological change in China had eroded female silk production, by the fifteenth century artisan opportunities were declining for European women as well. Most women’s guilds were gone, and women were restricted or banned from many others. Even brothels were run by men. In England, guild regulations now outlawed women’s participation in manufacturing particular fabrics and forbade their being trained on new and larger weaving machines. Women might still spin thread, but the more lucrative and skilled task of weaving fell increasingly to men. Technological progress may have been one reason for this change. Wate<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/> and anima<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>powered grain mills replaced the han<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>grinding previously undertaken by women, and larger looms making heavier cloth replaced the lighter looms that women had worked. Men increasingly took over these professions and trained their sons as apprentices, making it more difficult for women to remain active in these fields.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0123"><p>The Church had long offered some women an alternative to home, marriage, family, and rural life. As in Buddhist lands, substantial numbers of women, particularly from aristocratic families, were attracted to the secluded monastic life of poverty, chastity, and obedience within a convent, in part for the relative freedom from male control that it offered. Here was one of the few places where women might exercise authority as abbesses of their orders and obtain a measure of education. The twelfth-century abbess Hildegard of Bingen, for example, won wide acclaim for her writings on theology, medicine, botany, and music.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0124"><p>But by 1300, much of the independence that such abbesses and their nuns had enjoyed was curtailed and male control tightened, even as veneration of the Virgin Mary swept across Western Christendom. Restrictions on women hearing confessions, preaching, and chanting the Gospel were now more strictly enforced. The educational activities of monastic centers, where men and women could both participate, now gave way to the new universities, where only ordained men could study and teach. Furthermore, older ideas of women’s intellectual inferiority, the impurity of menstruation, and their role as sexual temptresses were mobilized to explain why women could never be priests and must operate under male control.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_433"><p>433</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0125"><p>Another religious opportunity for women, operating outside of monastic life and the institutional church, was that of the Beguines. These were groups of laywomen, often from poorer families in Northern Europe, who lived together, practiced celibacy, and devoted themselves to weaving and to working with the sick, the old, and the poor. Though widely respected for their piety and service, their independence from the church hierarchy prompted considerable opposition from both religious and secular authorities suspicious of women operating outside of male control, and the movement gradually faded away. More acceptable to male authorities was the role of anchoress, a woman who withdrew to a locked cell, usually attached to a church, where she devoted herself to prayer and fasting. Some anchoresses gained reputations for great holiness and were much sought after for spiritual guidance. The English mystic and anchoress Julian of Norwich (1342–1416), for example, acquired considerable public prominence and spiritual influence, even as she emphasized the feminine dimension of the Divine and portrayed Jesus as a mother, who “feeds us with Himself.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-009_20">20</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_434"><p>434</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0126"><p>Thus tightening male control of women took place in Europe as it did in Song dynasty China at about the same time. Accompanying this change was a new understanding of masculinity, at least in the growing towns and cities. No longer able to function as warriors protecting their women, men increasingly defined themselves as “providers”; a man’s role was to brave the new marketplaces “to win wealth for himself and his children.” In one popular tale, a woman praised her husband: “He was a good provider; he knew how to rake in the money and how to save it.” By 1450, the English word “husband” had become a verb meaning “to keep” or “to save.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-009_21">21</span></p></div>
