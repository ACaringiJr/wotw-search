<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0129"><p>While the Mexica were constructing an empire in Mesoamerica, a relatively small community of Quechu<span data-block_type="nobr">a-</span><wbr/>speaking people, known to us as the Incas, was building the Western Hemisphere’s largest imperial state along the entire spine of the Andes Mountains. Much as the Aztecs drew on the traditions of the Toltecs and Teotihuacán, the Incas incorporated the lands and cultures of earlier Andean civilizations: the Chavín, Moche, Wari, and Tiwanaku. The Inca Empire, however, was much larger than the Aztec state; it stretched some 2,500 miles along the Andes and contained perhaps 10 million subjects. Although the Aztec Empire controlled only part of the Mesoamerican cultural region, the Inca state encompassed practically the whole of Andean civilization during its short life in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. In the speed of its creation and the extent of its territory, the Inca Empire bears some similarity to that of the Mongols.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0130"><p>Both the Aztec and Inca empires represent rags-to-riches stories in which quite modest and remotely located people very quickly created by military conquest the largest states ever witnessed in their respective regions, but the empires themselves were quite different. In the Aztec realm, the Mexica rulers largely left their conquered people alone, if the required tribute was forthcoming. No elaborate administrative system arose to integrate the conquered territories or to assimilate their people to Aztec culture.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0133"><p>In what ways did Inca authorities seek to integrate their vast domains?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0131"><p>The Incas, on the other hand, erected a rather more bureaucratic empire. At the top reigned the emperor, an absolute ruler regarded as divine, a descendant of the creator god Viracocha and the son of the sun god Inti. Each of the some eighty provinces in the empire had an Inca governor. In theory, the state owned all land and resources, though in practice state lands, known as “lands of the sun,” existed alongside properties owned by temples, elites, and traditional communities. At least in the central regions of the empire, subjects were grouped into hierarchical units of 10, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 people, each headed by local officials, who were appointed and supervised by an Inca governor or the emperor. A separate set of “inspectors” provided the imperial center with an independent check on provincial officials. Births, deaths, marriages, and other population data were carefully recorded on <em>quipus</em>, the knotted cords that served as an accounting device. A resettlement program moved one-quarter or more of the population to new locations, in part to disperse conquered and no doubt resentful people and sometimes to reward loyal followers with promising opportunities. Efforts at cultural integration required the leaders of conquered peoples to learn Quechua. Their sons were removed to the capital of Cuzco for instruction in Inca culture and language. Even now, millions of people from Ecuador to Chile still speak Quechua, and it is the official second language of Peru after Spanish.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0134"><p>But the sheer human variety of the Incas’ enormous empire required great flexibility. In some places Inca rulers encountered bitter resistance; in others local elites were willing to accommodate Incas and thus benefit from their inclusion in the empire. Where centralized political systems already existed, Inca overlords could delegate control to native authorities. Elsewhere they had to construct an administrative system from scratch. Everywhere they sought to incorporate local people into the lower levels of the administrative hierarchy. While the Incas required their subject peoples to acknowledge major Inca deities, these peoples were then largely free to carry on their own religious traditions. The Inca Empire was a fluid system that varied greatly from place to place and over time. It depended as much on the posture of conquered peoples as on the demands and desires of Inca authorities.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0135"><p>Like the Aztec Empire, the Inca state represented an especially dense and extended network of economic relationships within the “American web,” but these relationships took shape in quite a different fashion. Inca demands on their conquered people were expressed, not so much in terms of tribute, but as labor service, known as <em>mita</em>, which was required periodically of every household. What people produced at home usually stayed at home, but almost everyone also had to work for the state. Some labored on large state farms or on “sun farms,” which supported temples and religious institutions; others herded, mined, served in the military, or toiled on state-directed construction projects.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p035w"><p>The AP<sup>®</sup> exam frequently includes questions about the Inca economic system.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0136"><p>Those with particular skills were put to work manufacturing textiles, metal goods, ceramics, and stonework. The most well-known of these specialists were the “chosen women,” who were removed from their homes as young girls, trained in Inca ideology, and set to producing corn beer and cloth at state centers. Later they were given as wives to men of distinction or sent to serve as priestesses in various temples, where they were known as “wives of the Sun.” In return for such labor services, Inca ideology, expressed in terms of family relationships, required the state to arrange elaborate feasts at which large quantities of food and drink were consumed and to provide food and other necessities when disaster struck. Thus the authority of the state penetrated and directed Inca society and economy far more than did that of the Aztecs. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource134" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 13.4</span>, for an early Spanish account of Inca governing practices.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0137"><p>If the Inca and Aztec civilizations differed sharply in their political and economic arrangements, they resembled each other more closely in their gender systems. Both societies practiced what scholars call “gender parallelism,” in which “women and men operate in two separate but equivalent spheres, each gender enjoying autonomy in its own sphere.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch12-sec2-010_18">18</span></p></div>
<div data-type="box" data-block_type="ap_tip" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-bx1-001x"><div data-type="box_inner">
<h3 data-type="title" data-for_type="box" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-ch12-bx1-001x">AP® EXAM TIP</h3>
<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p035x"><p>Note these continued comparisons between the Aztecs and Incas. Pay attention to their social structures.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0138"><p>In both Mesoamerican and Andean societies, such systems had emerged long before their incorporation into the Aztec and Inca empires. In the Andes, men reckoned their descent from their fathers and women from their mothers, while Mesoamericans had long viewed children as belonging equally to their mothers and fathers. Parallel religious cults for women and men likewise flourished in both societies. Inca men venerated the sun, while women worshipped the moon, with matching religious officials. In Aztec temples, both male and female priests presided over rituals dedicated to deities of both sexes. Particularly among the Incas, parallel hierarchies of male and female political officials governed the empire, while in Aztec society, women officials exercised local authority under a title that meant “female person in charge of people.” Social roles were clearly defined and different for men and women, but the domestic concerns of women — childbirth, cooking, weaving, cleaning — were not regarded as inferior to the activities of men. Among the Aztecs, for example, sweeping was a powerful and sacred act with symbolic significance as “an act of purification and a preventative against evil elements penetrating the center of the Aztec universe, the home.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch12-sec2-010_19">19</span> In the Andes, men broke the ground, women sowed, and both took part in the harvest.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p0139"><p>This was gender complementarity, not gender equality. Men occupied the top positions in both political and religious life, and male infidelity was treated more lightly than was women’s unfaithfulness. As the Inca and Aztec empires expanded, military life, limited to men, grew in prestige, perhaps skewing an earlier gender parallelism. The Incas in particular imposed a more rigidly patriarchal order on their subject peoples. In other ways, the new Aztec and Inca rulers adapted to the gender systems of the people they had conquered. Among the Aztecs, the tools of women’s work, the broom and the weaving spindle, were ritualized as weapons; sweeping the home was believed to assist men at war; and childbirth was regarded by women as “our kind of war.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch12-sec2-010_20">20</span> Inca rulers replicated the gender parallelism of their subjects at a higher level, as the <em>sapay Inca</em> (the Inca ruler) and the <em>coya</em> (his female consort) governed jointly, claiming descent respectively from the sun and the moon.</p></div>
