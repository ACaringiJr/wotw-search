<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0108"><p>If the empire transformed the conquered peoples, it also fundamentally changed Russia itself. Within an increasingly multiethnic empire, Russians diminished as a proportion of the overall population, although they remained politically dominant. Among the growing number of no<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>Russians in the empire, Slavi<span data-block_type="nobr">c-</span><wbr/>speaking Ukrainians and Belorussians predominated, while the vast territories of Siberia and the steppes housed numerous separate peoples, but with quite small populations.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-008_24">24</span> The wealth of empire — rich agricultural lands, valuable furs, mineral deposits — played a major role in making Russia one of the great powers of Europe by the eighteenth century, and it has enjoyed that position ever since.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p035x"><p>Russia’s “westernization” process in this — and the next — era is a common topic on the AP<sup>®</sup> exam.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0109"><p>Unlike its expansion to the east, Russia’s westward movement occurred in the context of military rivalries with the major powers of the region — the Ottoman Empire, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Prussia, and Austria. During the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Russia acquired substantial territories in the Baltic region, Poland, and Ukraine. This contact with Europe also fostered an awareness of Russia’s backwardness relative to Europe and prompted an extensive program of westernization, particularly under the leadership of Peter the Great (r. 1689–1725). His massive efforts included vast administrative changes, the enlargement and modernization of Russian military forces, a new educational system for the sons of noblemen, and dozens of manufacturing enterprises. Russian nobles were instructed to dress in European styles and to shave their sacred and much-revered beards. The newly created capital city of St. Petersburg was to be Russia’s “window on the West.” One of Peter’s successors, Catherine the Great (r. 1762–1796), followed up with further efforts to Europeanize Russian cultural and intellectual life, viewing herself as part of the European Enlightenment. Thus Russians were the first of many peoples to measure themselves against the West and to mount major “catch-up” efforts.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0110"><p>But this European-oriented and Christian state had also become an Asian power, bumping up against China, India, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire. It was on the front lines of the encounter between Christendom and the world of Islam. This straddling of Asia and Europe was the source of a long-standing identity problem that has troubled educated Russians for 300 years. Was Russia a backward European country, destined to follow the lead of more highly developed Western European societies? Or was it different, uniquely Slavic or even Asian, shaped by its Mongol legacy and its status as an Asian power? It is a question that Russians have not completely answered even in the twenty-first century. Either way, the very size of that empire, bordering on virtually all of the great agrarian civilizations of outer Eurasia, turned Russia, like many empires before it, into a highly militarized state, “a society organized for continuous war,” according to one scholar.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-008_25">25</span> It also reinforced the highly autocratic character of the Russian Empire because such a huge state arguably required a powerful monarchy to hold its vast domains and highly diverse peoples together.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0111"><p>Clearly, the Russians had created an empire, similar to those of Western Europe in terms of conquest, settlement, exploitation, religious conversion, and feelings of superiority. Nonetheless, the Russians had acquired their empire under different circumstances than did the Western Europeans. The Spanish and the British had conquered and colonized the New World, an ocean away and wholly unknown to them before 1492. They acquired those empires only after establishing themselves as distinct European states. The Russians, on the other hand, absorbed adjacent territories, and they did so at the same time that a modern Russian state was taking shape. “The British had an empire,” wrote historian Geoffrey Hosking. “Russia <em>was</em> an empire.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-008_26">26</span> Perhaps this helps explain the unique longevity of the Russian Empire. Whereas the Spanish, Portuguese, and British colonies in the Americas long ago achieved independence, the Russian Empire remained intact until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So thorough was Russian colonization that Siberia and much of the steppes remain still an integral part of the Russian state</p></div>
