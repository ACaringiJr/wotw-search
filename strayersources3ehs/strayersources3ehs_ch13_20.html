<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0131"><p>Like the Mughal state, the Ottoman Empire was also the creation of Turkic warrior groups, whose aggressive raiding of agricultural civilization was now legitimized in Islamic terms. Beginning around 1300 from a base area in northwestern Anatolia, these Ottoman Turks over the next three centuries swept over much of the Middle East, North Africa, and southeastern Europe to create the Islamic world’s most significant empire (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch13/STR_02272_13_M04.html" data-target="_pop">Map 13.4</span>). During those centuries, the Ottoman state was transformed from a small frontier principality to a prosperous, powerful, cosmopolitan empire, heir both to the Byzantine Empire and to leadership within the Islamic world. Its sultan combined the roles of a Turkic warrior prince, a Muslim caliph, and a conquering emperor, bearing the “strong sword of Islam” and serving as chief defender of the faith.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0132"><p>Gaining such an empire transformed Turkish social life as well. The relative independence of Central Asian pastoral women, their open association with men, and their political influence in society all diminished as the Turks adopted Islam, beginning in the tenth century, and later acquired an empire in the heartland of ancient and patriarchal Mediterranean civilizations. Now elite Turkish women found themselves secluded and often veiled; slave women from the Caucasus Mountains and the Sudan grew more numerous; official imperial censuses did not count women; and orthodox Muslim reformers sought to restrict women’s religious gatherings.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0133"><p>And yet within the new constraints of a settled Islamic empire, Turkish women retained something of the social power they had enjoyed in pastoral societies. From around 1550 to 1650, women of the royal court had such an influence in political matters that their critics referred to the “sultanate of women.” Islamic law permitted women important property rights, which enabled some to become quite wealthy, endowing religious and charitable institutions. Many women actively used the Ottoman courts to protect their legal rights in matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance, sometimes representing themselves or acting as agents for female relatives. In 1717, the wife of an English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire compared the lives of Turkish and European women, declaring, “’Tis very easy to see that they have more liberty than we have.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-011_31">31</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0134"><p>Within the Islamic world, the Ottoman Empire represented the growing prominence of Turkic people, for their empire now incorporated a large number of Arabs, among whom the religion had been born. The responsibility and the prestige of protecting Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem — the holy cities of Islam — now fell to the Ottoman Empire. A century-long conflict (1534–1639) between the Ottoman Empire, espousing the Sunni version of Islam, and the Persian Safavid Empire, holding fast to the Shia form of the faith, expressed a deep and enduring division within the Islamic world. Nonetheless, Persian culture, especially its poetry, painting, and traditions of imperial splendor, occupied a prominent position among the Ottoman elite.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p035ff"><p>The number of AP<sup>®</sup> exam questions about the Ottoman Empire’s political, social, and economic features have increased in recent years. Also note that the interactions between Muslims and Christians in the Ottoman Empire are an important topic.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0137"><p>The Ottoman Empire, like its Mughal counterpart, was the site of a highly significant cross-cultural encounter in the early modern era, adding yet another chapter to the long-running story of interaction between the Islamic world and Christendom. As the Ottoman Empire expanded across Anatolia, its mostly Christian population converted in large numbers to Islam as the Byzantine state visibly weakened and large numbers of Turks settled in the region. By 1500, some 90 percent of Anatolia’s inhabitants were Muslims and Turkic speakers. The climax of this Turkic assault on the Christian world of Byzantium occurred in 1453, when Constantinople fell to the invaders. Renamed Istanbul, that splendid Christian city became the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Byzantium, heir to the glory of Rome and the guardian of Orthodox Christianity, was no more.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0138"><p>In the empire’s southeastern European domains, known as the Balkans, the Ottoman encounter with Christian peoples unfolded quite differently than it had in Anatolia. In the Balkans, Muslims ruled over a large Christian population, but the scarcity of Turkish settlers and the willingness of the Ottoman authorities to accommodate the region’s Christian churches led to far fewer conversions. By the early sixteenth century, only about 19 percent of the area’s people were Muslims, and 81 percent were Christians.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0139"><p>Many of these Christians had welcomed Ottoman conquest because taxes were lighter and oppression less pronounced than under their former Christian rulers. Christian communities such as the Eastern Orthodox and Armenian Churches were granted considerable autonomy in regulating their internal social, religious, educational, and charitable affairs. Nonetheless, many Christian and Jewish women appealed legal cases dealing with marriage and inheritance to Muslim courts, where their property rights were greater. A substantial number of Christian men — Balkan landlords, Greek merchants, government officials, and high-ranking clergy — became part of the Ottoman elite, sometimes without converting to Islam. Jewish refugees, fleeing Christian persecution in a Spain recently “liberated” from Islamic rule, likewise found greater opportunity in the Ottoman Empire, where they became prominent in trade and banking circles. In these ways, Ottoman dealings with the Christian and Jewish populations of their empire broadly resembled Akbar’s policies toward the Hindu majority of Mughal India. In another way, however, Turkish rule bore heavily on Christians. Through a process known as the <em>devshirme</em> (devv-shirr-MEH) (the collecting or gathering), Ottoman authorities siphoned off many thousands of young boys from Christian families into the service of the state. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch13_21.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Devshirme</span>.) </p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0140"><p>Even though Ottoman authorities were relatively tolerant toward Christians within their borders, the empire itself represented an enormous threat to Christendom generally. The seizure of Constantinople, the conquest of the Balkans, Ottoman naval power in the Mediterranean, and the siege of Vienna in 1529 and again in 1683 raised anew “the specter of a Muslim takeover of all of Europe.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch13-sec2-011_32">32</span> (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource132" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 13.2</span>.)

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0142"><p>Indeed, the “terror of the Turk” inspired fear across much of Europe and placed Christendom on the defensive, even as Europeans were expanding aggressively across the Atlantic and into the Indian Ocean.</p></div>

The sixteent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century French philosopher Jean Bodin praised the religious tolerance of the Ottoman sultan in contrast to Christian intolerance: “The King of the Turks who rules over a great part of Europe safeguards the rites of religion as well as any prince in this world.
