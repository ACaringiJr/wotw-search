</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p0127"><p>Accompanying these transcontinental economic and political relationships was a substantial exchange of peoples and cultures. Mongol policy forcibly transferred many thousands of skilled craftsmen and educated people from their homelands to distant parts of the empire, while the Mongols’ religious tolerance and support of merchants drew missionaries and traders from afar. The Mongol capital at Karakorum was a cosmopolitan city with places of worship for Buddhists, Daoists, Muslims, and Christians. Chinggis Khan and several other Mongol rulers married Christian women. Actors and musicians from China, wrestlers from Persia, and a jester from Byzantium provided entertainment for the Mongol court. Persian and Arab doctors and administrators were sent to China, while Chinese physicians and engineers found their skills in demand in the Islamic world.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_483"><p>483</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p0128"><p>This movement of people facilitated the exchange of ideas and techniques, a process actively encouraged by Mongol authorities. A great deal of Chinese technology and artistic conventions — such as painting, printing, gunpowder weapons, compass navigation, high-temperature furnaces, and medical techniques — flowed westward. Acupuncture, for example, was poorly received in the Middle East because it required too much bodily contact for Muslim taste, but Chinese techniques for diagnosing illness by taking the pulse of patients proved quite popular, as they involved minimal body contact. Muslim astronomers brought their skills and knowledge to China because Mongol authorities wanted “second opinions on the reading of heavenly signs and portents” and assistance in constructing the accurate calendars needed for ritual purposes.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch11-sec2-010_25">25</span> Plants and crops likewise circulated within the Mongol domain. Lemons and carrots from the Middle East found a welcome reception in China, while the Persian il-khan Ghazan sent envoys to India, China, and elsewhere to seek “seeds of things which are unique in that land.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch11-sec2-010_26">26</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p-25"><p>Pay attention to this discussion of the many important effects of exchanges between the Mongols and their subjects.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p0129"><p>Europeans arguably gained more than most from these exchanges, for they had long been cut off from the fruitful interchange with Asia, and in comparison to the Islamic and Chinese worlds, they were less technologically developed. Now they could reap the benefits of new technology, new crops, and new knowledge of a wider world. And almost alone among the peoples of Eurasia, they could do so without having suffered the devastating consequences of Mongol conquest. In these circumstances, some historians have argued, lay the roots of Europe’s remarkable rise to global prominence in the centuries that followed.</p></div>
