</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0152"><p>World history is, to put it mildly, a big subject. To teachers and students alike, it can easily seem overwhelming in its detail. And yet the central task of world history is <em>not</em> the inclusion of endless facts or particular cases. It is rather to establish contexts or frameworks within which carefully selected facts and cases take on new meaning. In world history, every event, every process, every historical figure, and every culture, society, or civilization gain significance from their incorporation into some larger context or framework. Contextual thinking is central to world history.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p035ii"><p>In this section the author says it is essential to understand historical context if you wish to understand world history, and that understanding is precisely what the AP<sup>®</sup> exam will test. Now that you are about halfway through this text, consider the political (e.g., empire building), social (e.g., relations between governments and religions), and economic (e.g., the empires’ policies on trade) connections and comparisons that you have made thus far.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_588"><p>588</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0153"><p>The broad outlines of European colonization in the Americas are familiar to most American and European students. And yet, when that story is set in the context of other empire-building projects of the early modern era, it takes on new and different meanings. Such a context helps to counter any remaining Eurocentrism in our thinking about the past by reminding us that Western Europe was not the only center of vitality and expansion and that the interaction of culturally different peoples, so characteristic of the modern age, derived from multiple sources. How often do we notice that a European Christendom creating empires across the Atlantic was also the victim of Ottoman imperial expansion in the Balkans?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0154"><p>This kind of contextualizing also allows us to see more clearly the distinctive features of European empires as we view them in the mirror of other imperial creations. The Chinese, Mughal, and Ottoman empires continued older patterns of historical development, while those of Europe represented something wholly new in human history — an interacting Atlantic world of Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Furthermore, the European empires had a far greater impact on the peoples they incorporated than did other empires. Nowhere else did empire building generate such a catastrophic population collapse as in the Americas. Nor did Asian empires foster the kind of slave-based societies and transcontinental trade in slaves that were among the chief outcomes of Europe’s American colonies. Finally, Europe was enriched and transformed by its American possessions far more than China and the Ottomans were by their territorial acquisitions. Europeans gained enormous new biological resources from their empires — corn, potatoes, tomatoes, chocolate, tobacco, timber, and much more — as well as enormous wealth in the form of gold, silver, and land.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch13-p0155"><p>Should we need a motto for world history, consider this one: in world history, nothing stands alone; context is everything.</p></div>
