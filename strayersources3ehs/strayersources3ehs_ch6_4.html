</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p026"><p>At the broadest level, human cultures evolved in quite similar fashion around the world. All, of course, were part of that grand process of human migration that initially peopled the planet. Beginning in Africa, that vast movement of humankind subsequently encompassed Eurasia, Australia, the Americas, and Pacific Oceania. Almost everywhere, gathering, hunting, and fishing long remained the sole basis for sustaining life and society. Then, on the three supercontinents — Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas — the momentous turn of the Agricultural Revolution took place independently and in several distinct areas of each landmass (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch1_2.html">Chapter 1</span>). That revolutionary transformation of human life subsequently generated, in particularly rich agricultural environments of all three regions, those more complex societies that we know as civilizations, featuring cities, states, monumental architecture, and great social inequality (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch2_2.html">Chapter 2</span>). In these ways, the historical trajectory of the human journey has a certain unity and similarity across quite distinct continental regions. These commonalities provide the foundation for a genuinely global history of humankind. At the beginning of the Common Era, that trajectory had generated a total world population of about 250 million people, substantially less than the current population of the United States alone. By modern standards, it was still a sparsely populated planet.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p029"><p>The world’s human population was then distributed very unevenly across the three giant continents, as the <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_continental_population_in_the_second_wave_era_and_beyond.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot</span> on page 232 indicates. Eurasia was then home to more than 85 percent of the world’s people, Africa about 10 percent, the Americas around 5 percent, and Oceania less than 1 percent. That unevenness in population distribution, a pattern that has persisted to the present, is part of the reason why world historians focus more attention on Eurasia than on these other regions. Here lies one of the major differences among the continents.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p030"><p>There were others as well. The absence of most animals capable of domestication meant that few pastoral societies developed in the Americas, and only in pockets of the Andes Mountains based on the herding of llamas and alpacas. No animals were available in the Americas to pull plows or carts or to be ridden into combat. Africa too lacked wild sheep, goats, chickens, horses, and camels, but its proximity to Eurasia meant that these animals, once domesticated, became widely available to African peoples. Metallurgy in the Americas was likewise far less developed than in Eurasia and Africa, where iron tools and weapons played such an important role in economic and military life. In the Americas, writing was limited to the Mesoamerican region and was most highly developed among the Maya, whereas in Africa it was confined to the northern and northeastern parts of the continent. In Eurasia, by contrast, writing emerged elaborately in many regions. Furthermore, civilizations in Africa and the Americas were fewer in number and generally smaller than those of Eurasia, and larger numbers of people in those two continents lived outside the confines of any civilization in communities that did not feature cities and states.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p032"><p>A final continental comparison distinguishes the history of Africa from that of the Americas. Geography placed Africa adjacent to Eurasia, while it separated the Americas from both Africa and Eurasia. This has meant that parts of Africa frequently interacted with Eurasian civilizations. In fact, Mediterranean North Africa was long part of a larger zone of Afro-Eurasian interaction. Ancient Egyptian civilization was certainly in contact with Crete, Syria, and Mesopotamia and provided inspiration for the Greeks. The entire North African coastal region was incorporated into the Roman Empire and used to produce wheat and olives on large estates with slave labor. Christianity spread widely across North Africa, giving rise to some of the early Church’s most famous martyrs and theologians. The Christian faith found an even more permanent foothold in the lands now known as Ethiopia.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p035"><p>Arabia, located between Africa and Asia, was another point of contact with a wider world for African peoples. The arrival of the domesticated camel, probably from Arabia, generated a pastoral way of life among some of the Berber peoples of the western Sahara during the first three centuries <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> A little later, camels also made possible trans-Saharan commerce, which linked interior West Africa to the world of Mediterranean civilization. Over many centuries, the East African coast was a port of call for Egyptian, Roman, and Arab merchants, and that region subsequently became an integral part of Indian Ocean trading networks. The transoceanic voyages of Austronesian-speaking sailors from Southeast Asia brought various food crops of that region, bananas for example, to Madagascar and from there to the East African mainland. The Americas and Oceania, by contrast, developed almost wholly apart from this Afro-Eurasian network until that separation was breeched by the voyages of Columbus from 1492.</p></div>
