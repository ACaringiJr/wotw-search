</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0120"><p>In the vast region of Africa south of the equator, the most significant development during the secon<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave era involved the accelerating movement of Bant<span data-block_type="nobr">u-</span><wbr/>speaking peoples, cultures, and technologies into the enormous subcontinent. That process had begun many centuries earlier, probably around 3000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, from a homeland region in what are now southeastern Nigeria and the Cameroons. Over the long run, some 400 distinct but closely related languages emerged, known collectively as Bantu. By the first century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, agricultural peoples speaking Bantu languages and now bearing an ironworking technology had largely occupied the forest regions of equatorial Africa, and at least a few of them had probably reached the East African coast. In the several centuries that followed, they established themselves quite rapidly in most of eastern and southern Africa (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch6/STR_02272_06_M01.html" data-target="_pop">Map 6.1</span>), introducing immense economic and cultural changes to a huge region of the continent.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0121"><p>Bantu expansion was not a conquest or invasion such as that of Alexander the Great; nor was it a massive and sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>conscious migration like that of Europeans to the Americas in more recent times. Rather, it was a slow movement of peoples, perhaps a few extended families at a time. And sometimes Bantu expansion was less a movement of people than the diffusion of new patterns of living involving language, root crops, grains, sheep and cattle, pottery styles, and ironworking technology. In this way, alread<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>established communities could “become Bantu” without the wholesale migration of outsiders. Taken as a whole, these processes brought to Africa south of the equator a measure of cultural and linguistic commonality, marking it as a distinct region of the continent.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0122"><p>That movement of individuals and cultural patterns also generated numerous situations that required decisions about how to respond to new peoples, ideas, and technologies. Among those encounters, none was more significant than that between the agricultural Bantu and the gathering and hunting peoples who earlier occupied this region of Africa. Their interaction was part of a lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>term global phenomenon in which farmers largely replaced foragers as the dominant people on the planet (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch1_2.html">Chapter 1</span>).</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0125"><p>In what ways did the process of Bantu expansion stimulate cross-cultural interaction?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0123"><p>In these encounters, Bantu-speaking farmers had various advantages. One was numerical, as agriculture generated a more productive economy, enabling larger numbers to live in a smaller area than was possible with a gathering and hunting way of life. A second advantage was a greater immunity to animal-borne disease, acquired by prolonged exposure to both parasitic and infectious illnesses common to farming and herding societies. Foraging peoples lacked that immunity, and many quickly succumbed when they encountered the agricultural newcomers. A third advantage was iron, so useful for tools and weapons, which accompanied Bantu expansion in its interactions with peoples still operating with stone-age technology. Thus gathering and hunting peoples were displaced, absorbed, or largely eliminated in most parts of Africa south of the equator — but not everywhere.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0126"><p>In the rain forest region of Central Africa, the foraging Batwa (Pygmy) people, at least some of them, became “forest specialists” who produced honey, wild game, elephant products, animal skins, and medicinal barks and plants, all of which entered regional trading networks in exchange for the agricultural products of their Bantu neighbors. Some also adopted Bantu languages, thus becoming Bantu linguistically, while maintaining a gathering and hunting lifestyle and a separate identity.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0127"><p>Bantu-speaking peoples themselves also changed as they encountered different environments and peoples. In the drier climate of East Africa, the yam-based agriculture of the West African Bantu homeland was unable to support their growing numbers, so Bantu farmers increasingly adopted grains as well as domesticated sheep and cattle from the already-established people of the region. They also enriched their agriculture by acquiring a variety of food crops from Southeast Asia — coconuts, sugarcane, and especially bananas — which were brought to East Africa by Indonesian Malay sailors and immigrants early in the first millennium <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> This agricultural package and its associated ironworking technology then spread throughout the vast area of eastern and southern Africa, probably reaching present-day South Africa by 400 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> Some newly “Bantuized” areas incorporated musical traditions, linguistic patterns, and kinship systems derived from the earlier inhabitants. From these interactions a common set of cultural and social practices diffused widely across Bantu Africa. One prominent historian described these practices:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0128"><p>[They encompassed] in religion, the centrality of ancestor observances; in philosophy, the problem of evil understood as the consequence of individual malice or of the failure to honor one’s ancestors; in music, an emphasis on polyrhythmic performance with drums as the key instrument; in dance, a new form of expression in which a variety of prescribed body movements took preference over footwork; and in agriculture, the pre-eminence of women as the workers and innovators.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-009_12">12</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0129"><p>All of this became part of the common culture of Bantu-speaking Africa.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0130"><p>As Bantu-derived patterns of living became established in Africa south of the equator during the thousand or so years between 500 and 1500 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, a wide variety of quite distinct societies and cultures took shape. Some societies — in present-day Kenya, for example — organized themselves without any formal political specialists at all. Instead, they made decisions, resolved conflicts, and maintained order by using kinship structures or lineage principles supplemented by age grades, which joined men of a particular generation together across various lineages. Elsewhere, lineage heads who acquired a measure of personal wealth, or who proved skillful at mediating between the local spirits and the people, might evolve into chiefs with a modest political authority. In several areas, such as the region around Lake Victoria or present-day Zimbabwe, larger and more substantial kingdoms evolved. Along the East African coast after 1000 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, dozens of rival city-states linked the African interior with the commerce of the Indian Ocean basin (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch7_10.html" data-target="_pop">“Sea Roads: Exchange Across the Indian Ocean”</span> in Chapter 7).</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0131"><p>Many societies in the Bantu-speaking world developed gender systems that were markedly less patriarchal than those of established urban-based civilizations. Male ironworkers in the Congo River basin, for example, sought to appropriate the power and prestige of female reproductive capacity by decorating their furnaces with clay breasts and speaking of their bellows as impregnating the furnaces. Among the Luba people of Central Africa, male rulers operated in alliance with powerful women, particularly spirit mediums, who were thought to contain the spirit of the king. Only a woman’s body was considered sufficiently strong to acquire this potent and dangerous presence. Luba art represented female ancestors as “keepers of secret royal knowledge.” And across a wide area of south-central Africa, a system of “gender parallelism” associated female roles with village life (child care, farming, food preparation, making pots, baskets, and mats), while masculine identity revolved around hunting and forest life (fishing, trapping, collecting building materials and medicinal plants). It was a complementary or “separate but equal” definition of gender roles.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-009_13">13</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0132"><p>In terms of religion, Bantu practice in general placed less emphasis on a High or Creator God, who was viewed as remote and largely uninvolved in ordinary life, and focused instead on ancestral or nature spirits. The power of dead ancestors might be accessed through rituals of sacrifice, especially of cattle. Supernatural power deriving from ancient heroes, ancestors, or nature spirits also resided in charms, which could be activated by proper rituals and used to control the rains, defend the village, achieve success in hunting, or identify witches. Belief in witches was widespread, reflecting the idea that evil or misfortune was the work of malicious people. Diviners, skilled in penetrating the unseen world, used dreams, visions, charms, or trances to identify the source of misfortune and to prescribe remedies. Was a particular illness the product of broken taboos, a dishonored ancestor, an unhappy nature spirit, or a witch? Was a remedy to be found in a cleansing ceremony, a sacrifice to an ancestor, the activation of a charm, or the elimination of a witch?<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-009_14">14</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0133"><p>Unlike the major monotheistic religions, with their “once and for all” revelations from God through the Christian Bible or the Muslim Quran, Bantu religious practice was predicated on the notion of “continuous revelation” — the possibility of constantly receiving new messages from the world beyond through dreams, visions, or trance states. Moreover, unlike Buddhism, Christianity, or Islam, Bantu religions were geographically confined, intended to explain, predict, and control local affairs, with no missionary impulse or inclination toward universality.</p></div>
