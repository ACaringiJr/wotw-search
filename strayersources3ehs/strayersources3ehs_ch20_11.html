<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p083"><p>In various ways, the modern history of Japan paralleled that of Italy and Germany. All three were newcomers to great power status, with Japan joining the club of industrializing and empir<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>building states only in the late nineteenth century as its sole Asian member (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch19_17.html" data-target="_pop">“Modernization Japanese-Style”</span> in Chapter 19). Like Italy and Germany, Japan had a rather limited experience with democratic politics, for its elected parliament was constrained by a very small electorate (only 1.5 million men in 1917) and by the exalted position of a sem<span data-block_type="nobr">i-</span><wbr/>divine emperor and his small coterie of elite advisers. During the 1930s, Japan too moved toward authoritarian government and a denial of democracy at home, even as it launched an aggressive program of territorial expansion in East Asia.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p086"><p>How did Japan’s experience during the 1920s and 1930s resemble that of Germany, and how did it differ?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p084"><p>Despite these broad similarities, Japan’s history in the first half of the twentieth century was clearly distinctive. In sharp contrast to Italy and Germany, Japan participated only minimally in World War I, and it experienced considerable economic growth as other industrialized countries were consumed by the European conflict. At the peace conference ending that war, Japan was seated as an equal participant, allied with the winning side of democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p087"><p>During the 1920s, Japan seemed to be moving toward more democratic politics and Western cultural values. Universal male suffrage was achieved in 1925; cabinets led by leaders of the major parties, rather than bureaucrats or imperial favorites, governed the country; and a tw<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>party system began to emerge. Supporters of these developments generally embraced the dignity of the individual, free expression of ideas, and greater gender equality. Education expanded; an urban consumer society developed; middl<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>class women entered new professions; young women known as <em>moga</em> (modern girls) sported short hair and short skirts, while dancing with <em>mobo</em> (modern boys) at jazz clubs and cabarets. To such people, the Japanese were becoming world citizens and their country was becoming “a province of the world” as they participated increasingly in a cosmopolitan and international culture.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p098"><p>In this environment, the accumulated tensions of Japan’s modernizing and industrializing processes found expression. “Rice riots” in 1918 brought more than a million people into the streets of urban Japan to protest the rising price of that essential staple. Union membership tripled in the 1920s as some factory workers began to think in terms of entitlements and workers’ rights rather than the benevolence of their employers. In rural areas, tenant unions multiplied, and disputes with landowners increased amid demands for a reduction in rents. A mounting women’s movement advocated a variety of feminist issues, including suffrage and the end of legalized prostitution. “All the sleeping women are now awake and moving,” declared Yosano Akiko, a well-known poet, feminist, and social critic. Within the political arena, a number of “proletarian parties” — the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist People’s Party, and a small Japan Communist Party — promised radical change, what one of them referred to as “the political, economic and social emancipation of the proletarian class.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch20-sec2-005_9">9</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p099"><p>For many people in established elite circles — bureaucrats, landowners, industrialists, military officials — all of this was both appalling and alarming, suggesting echoes of the Russian Revolution of 1917. A number of political activists were arrested, and a few were killed. A Peace Preservation Law, enacted in 1925, promised long prison sentences, or even the death penalty, to anyone who organized against the existing imperial system of government or private property.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_904"><p>904</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0100"><p>As in Germany, however, it was the impact of the Great Depression that paved the way for harsher and more authoritarian action. That worldwide economic catastrophe hit Japan hard. The shrinking world demand for silk impoverished millions of rural dwellers who raised silkworms. Japan’s exports fell by half between 1929 and 1931, leaving a million or more urban workers unemployed. Many young workers returned to their rural villages only to find food scarce, families forced to sell their daughters to urban brothels, and neighbors unable to offer the customary money for the funerals of their friends. In these desperate circumstances, many began to doubt the ability of parliamentary democracy and capitalism to address Japan’s “national emergency.” Politicians and business leaders alike were widely regarded as privileged, self-centered, and heedless of the larger interests of the nation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0101"><p>Such conditions energized a growing movement in Japanese political life known as Radical Nationalism or the Revolutionary Right. Expressed in dozens of small groups, it was especially appealing to younger army officers. The movement’s many separate organizations shared an extreme nationalism, hostility to parliamentary democracy, a commitment to elite leadership focused around an exalted emperor, and dedication to foreign expansion. The manifesto of one of those organizations, the Cherry Blossom Society, expressed these sentiments clearly in 1930:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_905"><p>905</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0102"><p>As we observe recent social trends, top leaders engage in immoral conduct, political parties are corrupt, capitalists and aristocrats have no understanding of the masses, farming villages are devastated, unemployment and depression are serious…. The rulers neglect the long term interests of the nation, strive to win only the pleasure of foreign powers and possess no enthusiasm for external expansion…. The people are with us in craving the appearance of a vigorous and clean government that is truly based upon the masses, and is genuinely centered around the Emperor.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch20-sec2-005_10">10</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0103"><p>Members of such organizations managed to assassinate a number of public officials and prominent individuals, in the hope of provoking a return to direct rule by the emperor, and in 1936 a group of junior officers attempted a military takeover of the government, which was quickly suppressed. In sharp contrast to developments in Italy and Germany, however, no right-wing party gained wide popular support, nor was any such party able to seize power in Japan. Although individuals and small groups sometimes espoused ideas similar to those of European fascists, no major fascist party emerged. Nor did Japan produce any charismatic leader on the order of Mussolini or Hitler. People arrested for political offenses were neither criminalized nor exterminated, as in Germany, but instead were subjected to a process of “resocialization” that brought the vast majority of them to renounce their “errors” and return to the “Japanese way.” Japan’s established institutions of government were sufficiently strong, and traditional notions of the nation as a family headed by the emperor were sufficiently intact, to prevent the development of a widespread fascist movement able to take control of the country.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0104"><p>In the 1930s, though, Japanese public life clearly changed in ways that reflected the growth of right-wing nationalist thinking. Parties and the parliament continued to operate, and elections were held, but major cabinet positions now went to prominent bureaucratic or military figures rather than to party leaders. The military in particular came to exercise a more dominant role in Japanese political life, although military men had to negotiate with business and bureaucratic elites as well as party leaders. Censorship limited the possibilities of free expression, and a single news agency was granted the right to distribute all national and most international news to the country’s newspapers and radio stations. An Industrial Patriotic Federation replaced independent trade unions with factory-based “discussion councils” to resolve local disputes between workers and managers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0105"><p>Established authorities also adopted many of the ideological themes of these radical right-wing groups. In 1937, the Ministry of Education issued a new textbook, <em>Cardinal Principles of the National Entity of Japan</em>, for use in all Japanese schools. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource202" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 20.2</span>.) That document proclaimed the Japanese to be “intrinsically quite different from the s<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>called citizens of the Occidental [Western] countries.” Those nations were “conglomerations of separate individuals” with “no deep foundation between ruler and citizen to unite them.” In Japan, by contrast, an emperor of divine origin related to his subjects as a father to his children. It was a natural, not a contractual, relationship, expressed most fully in the “sacrifice of the life of a subject for the Emperor.” In addition to studying this text, students were now required to engage in more physical training, in which Japanese martial arts replaced baseball in the physical education curriculum.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_906"><p>906</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0106"><p>The erosion of democracy and the rise of the military in Japanese political life reflected long-standing Japanese respect for the military values of the ancient samurai warrior class as well as the relatively independent position of the military in Japan’s Meiji constitution. The state’s success in quickly bringing the country out of the Depression likewise fostered popular support. As in Nazi Germany, state-financed credit, large-scale spending on armaments, and public works projects enabled Japan to emerge from the Depression more rapidly and more fully than major Western countries. “By the end of 1937,” noted one Japanese laborer, “everybody in the country was working.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch20-sec2-005_11">11</span> By the mid-1930s, the government increasingly assumed a supervisory or managerial role in economic affairs that included subsidies to strategic industries; profit ceilings on major corporations; caps on wages, prices, and rents; and a measure of central planning. Private property, however, was retained, and the huge industrial enterprises called <em>zaibatsu</em> continued to dominate the economic landscape.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch20-p0107"><p>Although Japan during the 1930s shared some common features with fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, it remained, at least internally, a less repressive and more pluralistic society than either of those European states. Japanese intellectuals and writers had to contend with government censorship, but they retained some influence in the country. Generals and admirals exercised great political authority as the role of an elected parliament declined, but they did not govern alone. Political prisoners were few and were not subjected to execution or deportation as in European fascist states. Japanese conceptions of their racial purity and uniqueness were directed largely against foreigners rather than an internal minority. Nevertheless, like Germany and Italy, Japan developed extensive imperial ambitions. Those projects of conquest and empire building collided with the interests of established world powers such as the United States and Britain, launching a second, and even more terrible, global war.</p></div>
