The twelft<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century world into which he was born found the Mongols an unstable and fractious collection of tribes and clans, much reduced from a somewhat earlier and more powerful position in the shifting alliances in what is now Mongolia. “Everyone was feuding,” declared a leading Mongol shaman. “Rather than sleep, they robbed each other of their possessions…. There was no respite, only battle. There was no affection, only mutual slaughter.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch11-sec2-003_9">9</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p062"><p>The early life of Temujin showed few signs of a prominent future. The boy’s father had been a minor chieftain of a noble clan, but he was murdered by tribal rivals before Temujin turned ten, and the family was soon deserted by other members of the clan. As social outcasts without livestock, Temujin’s small family, headed by his resourceful mother, was forced to abandon pastoralism, living instead by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild foods. It was an enormous and humiliating drop in their social status. In these desperate circumstances, Temujin’s remarkable character came into play. His personal magnetism and courage and his inclination to rely on trusted friends rather than ties of kinship allowed him to build up a small following and to ally with a more powerful tribal leader. This alliance received a boost from Chinese patrons, who were always eager to keep the pastoralists divided. Military victory over a rival tribe resulted in Temujin’s recognition as a chief in his own right with a growing band of followers.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p065"><p>Temujin’s rise to power within the complex tribal politics of Mongolia was a surprise to everyone. It took place amid shifting alliances and betrayals, a mounting string of military victories, the indecisiveness of his enemies, a reputation as a leader generous to friends and ruthless to enemies, and the incorporation of warriors from defeated tribes into his own forces. In 1206, a Mongol tribal assembly recognized Temujin as Chinggis Khan, supreme leader of a now unified Great Mongol Nation. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource111" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 11.1</span>.) It was a remarkable achievement, but one little noticed beyond the highland steppes of Mongolia. That would soon change.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p066"><p>The unification of the Mongol tribes raised an obvious question: what was Chinggis Khan to do with the powerful army he had assembled? Without a common task, the new and fragile unity of the Mongols would surely dissolve into quarrels and chaos; and without external resources to reward his followers, Chinggis Khan would be har<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>pressed to maintain his supreme position. Both considerations pointed in a single direction — expansion, particularly toward China, long a source of great wealth for pastoral peoples.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p067"><p>In 1209, the first major attack on the settled agricultural societies south of Mongolia set in motion half a century of a Mongol world war, a series of military campaigns, massive killing, and empire building without precedent in world history. In the process, Chinggis Khan, followed by his sons and grandsons (Ogodei, Mongke, and Khubilai), constructed an empire that contained China, Korea, Central Asia, Russia, much of the Islamic Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch11/STR_02272_11_M01.html" data-target="_pop">Map 11.1</span>). “In a flash,” wrote a recent scholar, “the Mongol warriors would defeat every army, capture every fort, and bring down the walls of every city they encountered. Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus would soon kneel before the dusty boots of illiterate young Mongol horsemen.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch11-sec2-003_10">10</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch11-p068"><p>Various setbacks marked the outer limits of the Mongol Empire — the Mongols’ withdrawal from Eastern Europe (1242), their defeat at Ain Jalut in Palestine at the hands of Egyptian forces (1260), the failure of their invasion of Japan owing to typhoons, and the difficulty of penetrating the tropical jungles of Southeast Asia. But what an empire it was! How could a Mongol confederation, with a total population of less than 1 million people and few resources beyond their livestock, assemble an imperial structure of such staggering transcontinental dimensions?
