</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p060"><p>Once they came to power, communist parties everywhere set about the construction of socialist societies. In the Soviet Union, this massive undertaking occurred under the leadership of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and 1930s. The corresponding Chinese effort took place during the 1950s and 1960s with Mao Zedong at the helm.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_939"><p>939</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p061"><p>To communist regimes, building socialism meant first of all the modernization and industrialization of their backward societies. They sought, however, a distinctly socialist modernity. This involved a frontal attack on long-standing inequalities of class and gender, an effort to prevent the making of new inequalities as the process of modern development unfolded, and the promotion of cultural values of selflessness and collectivism that could support a socialist society.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p062"><p>Those imperatives generated a political system thoroughly dominated by the Communist Party. Top-ranking party members enjoyed various privileges but were expected to be exemplars of socialism in the making by being disciplined, selfless, and utterly loyal to their country’s Marxist ideology. The party itself penetrated society in ways that Western scholars called “totalitarian,” for other parties were forbidden, the state controlled almost the entire economy, and political authorities ensured that the arts, education, and the media conformed to approved ways of thinking. Mass organizations for women, workers, students, and various professional groups operated under party control, with none of the independence that characterized civil society in the West.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_940"><p>940</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p063"><p>In undertaking these tasks, the Soviet Union and China started from different places, most notably their international positions. In 1917, Russian Bolsheviks faced a hostile capitalist world alone, while Chinese communists, coming to power over thirty years later, had an established Soviet Union as a friendly northern neighbor and ally. Furthermore, Chinese revolutionaries had actually governed parts of their huge country for decades, gaining experience that the new Soviet rulers had altogether lacked, since they had come to power so quickly. And the Chinese communists were firmly rooted in the rural areas and among the country’s vast peasant population, while their Russian counterparts had found their support mainly in the cities.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p064"><p>If these comparisons generally favored China in its efforts to “build socialism,” in economic terms that country faced even more daunting prospects than did the Soviet Union. Its population was far greater, its industrial base far smaller, and the availability of new agricultural land far more limited than in the Soviet Union. Likewise, in China fewer people were literate, and the education system and transportation network were much less developed. Even more than the Soviets, Chinese communists had to build a modern society from the ground up.</p></div>
