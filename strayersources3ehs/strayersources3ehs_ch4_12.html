</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p098"><p>Strangely enough, Buddhism as a distinct religious practice ultimately died out in the land of its birth as it was reincorporated into a broader Hindu tradition, but it spread widely and flourished, particularly in its Mahayana form, in other parts of Asia. Buddhism declined in India perhaps in part because the mounting wealth of monasteries and the economic interests of their leading figures separated them from ordinary people. Competition from Islam after 1000 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> also played a role. But the most important reason for the waning of Buddhism in India was the growth during the first millennium <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> of a new kind of popular Hinduism, which the masses found more accessible than the elaborate sacrifices of the Brahmins or the philosophical speculations of intellectuals. Expressed in the widely known epic poems called the <em>Mahabharata</em> (ma<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>ha<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>BA<span data-block_type="nobr">H-</span><wbr/>ra<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>tah) and the <em>Ramayana</em>, this revived Hinduism indicated more clearly that action in the world and the detached performance of caste duties might also provide a path to liberation. It was perhaps a response to the challenge of Buddhism.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0101"><p>In the much-beloved Hindu text known as the Bhagavad Gita (BUH-guh-vahd GEE-tuh), the troubled warrior-hero Arjuna is in anguish over the necessity of killing his kinsmen as a decisive battle approaches. But he is assured by his charioteer Lord Krishna, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, that performing his duty as a warrior, and doing so selflessly without regard to consequences, is an act of devotion that would lead to “release from the shackles of repeated rebirth.” This was not an invitation to militarism, but rather an affirmation that ordinary people, not just Brahmins, could also find spiritual fulfillment by selflessly performing the ordinary duties of their lives: “The man who, casting off all desires, lives free from attachments, who is free from egoism, and from the feeling that this or that is mine, obtains tranquility.” Withdrawal and asceticism were not the only ways to moksha.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0102"><p>Also becoming increasingly prominent was yet another religious path — the way of devotion to one or another of India’s many gods and goddesses. Beginning in south India and moving northward, this <em>bhakti</em> (BAHK-tee) (worship) movement involved the intense adoration of and identification with a particular deity through songs, prayers, and rituals. By far the most popular deities were Vishnu, the protector and preserver of creation who was associated with mercy and goodness, and Shiva, a god representing the Divine in its destructive aspect, but many others also had their followers. This form of Hindu expression sometimes pushed against the rigid caste and gender hierarchies of Indian society by inviting all to an adoration of the Divine. After all, Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita had declared that “those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, vaishyas [merchants] and shudras [workers] — can attain the supreme destination.”</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0103"><p>The proliferation of gods and goddesses, and of their bhakti cults, occasioned very little friction or serious religious conflict. “Hinduism,” writes a leading scholar, “is essentially tolerant, and would rather assimilate than rigidly exclude.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch04-sec2-006_14">14</span> This capacity for assimilation extended to an already-declining Buddhism, which for many people had become yet another cult worshipping yet another god. The Buddha in fact was incorporated into the Hindu pantheon as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu. By 1000 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, Buddhism had largely disappeared as a separate religious tradition within India.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch04-p0104"><p>Thus a constantly evolving and enormously varied South Asian religious tradition had been substantially transformed. An early emphasis on ritual sacrifice gave way to that of philosophical speculation, devotional worship, and detached action in the world. In the process, that tradition had generated Buddhism, which became the first of the great universal religions of world history, and then had absorbed that new faith back into the fold of an emerging popular Hinduism.</p></div>
