</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0148"><p>Although Mesopotamia and Egypt represented separate and distinct civilizations, they interacted frequently with each other and with both near and more distant neighbors. Even in these ancient times, the First Civilizations were embedded in larger networks of commerce, culture, and power. None of them stood alone.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0151"><p>In what ways were Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations shaped by their interactions with near and distant neighbors?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0149"><p>The early beginnings of Egyptian civilization illustrate the point. Its agriculture drew upon wheat and barley, which likely reached Egypt from Mesopotamia, as well as gourds, watermelon, domesticated donkeys, and cattle, which came from the Sudan to the south. The practice of “divine kingship” probably derived from the central or eastern Sudan, where small-scale agricultural communities had long viewed their rulers as sacred and buried them with various servants and officials. From this complex of influences, the Egyptians created something distinct and unique, but that civilization had roots in both Africa and Southwest Asia.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p035t"><p>You should know that early Mesopotamians and Egyptians traded with one another, as did Mesopotamians and the Indus Valley civilizations.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0152"><p>Furthermore, once they were established, both Mesopotamia and Egypt carried on long-distance trade, mostly in luxury goods destined for the elite. Sumerian merchants had established seaborne contact with the Indus Valley civilization as early as 2300 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, while Indus Valley traders and their interpreters had taken up residence in Mesopotamia. Other trade routes connected it to Anatolia (present-day Turkey), Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan. During Akkadian rule over Mesopotamia, a Sumerian poet described its capital of Agade:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p035u"><p>Ideas, technology, people, and animals – and of course, goods – were exchanged across trade routes. This is a very important concept throughout AP<sup>®</sup> World History.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0158"><p>All of this and more came from far away.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0159"><p>Egyptian trade likewise extended far afield. Beyond its involvement with the Mediterranean and the Middle East, Egyptian trading journeys extended deep into Africa, including Nubia, south of Egypt in the Nile Valley, and Punt, along the East African coast of Ethiopia and Somalia. One Egyptian official described his return from an expedition to Nubia: “I came down with three hundred donkeys laden with incense, ebony, … panther skins, elephant tusks, throw sticks, and all sorts of good products.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-012_22">22</span> What most intrigued the very young pharaoh who sent him, however, was a dancing dwarf who accompanied the expedition back to Egypt.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0160"><p>Along with trade goods went cultural influence from the civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Among the smaller societies of the region to feel this influence were the Hebrews. Their sacred writings, recorded in the Old Testament, showed the influence of Mesopotamia in the “eye for an eye” principle of their legal system and in the story of a flood that destroyed the world. The Phoenicians, who were commercially active in the Mediterranean basin from their homeland in present-day Lebanon, also were influenced by Mesopotamian civilization. They venerated Asarte, a local form of the Mesopotamian fertility goddess Istar. They also adapted the Sumerian cuneiform method of writing to a much easier alphabetic system, which later became the basis for Greek and Latin writing. Various Indo-European peoples, dispersing probably from north-central Anatolia, also incorporated Sumerian deities into their own religions as well as bronze metallurgy and the wheel into their economies. When their widespread migrations carried them across much of Eurasia, they took these Sumerian cultural artifacts with them.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0161"><p>Egyptian cultural influence likewise spread in several directions. Nubia, located to the south of Egypt in the Nile Valley, not only traded with its more powerful neighbor but also was subject to periodic military intervention and political control from Egypt. Skilled Nubian archers were actively recruited for service as mercenaries in Egyptian armies. They often married Egyptian women and were buried in Egyptian style. All of this led to the diffusion of Egyptian culture in Nubia, expressed in building Egyptian-style pyramids, worshipping Egyptian gods and goddesses, and making use of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing. Despite this cultural borrowing, Nubia remained a distinct civilization, developing its own alphabetic script, retaining many of its own gods, developing a major ironworking industry by 500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, and asserting its political independence whenever possible. The Nubian kingdom of Kush, in fact, invaded Egypt in 760 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> and ruled it for about 100 years. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch6_7.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Piye, Kushite Conqueror of Egypt</span>.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0162"><p>In the Mediterranean basin, clear Egyptian influence is visible in the art of Minoan civilization, which emerged on the island of Crete about 2500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> More controversial has been the claim by historian Martin Bernal in a muc<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>publicized book, <em>Black Athena</em> (1987), that ancient Greek culture — its art, religion, philosophy, and language — drew heavily upon Egyptian as well as Mesopotamian precedents. His book lit up a passionate debate among scholars. To some of his critics, Bernal seemed to undermine the originality of Greek civilization by suggesting that it had Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Asian origins. His supporters accused the critics of Eurocentrism. Whatever its outcome, the controversy surrounding Bernal’s book served to focus attention on Egypt’s relationship to black Africa and to the world of the Mediterranean basin.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0163"><p>Influence was not a on<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>way street, however, as Egypt and Mesopotamia likewise felt the impact of neighboring peoples. Pastoral peoples, speaking Ind<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>European languages and living in what is now southern Russia, had domesticated the horse by perhaps 4000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> and later learned to tie that powerful animal to wheeled carts and chariots. This new technology provided a fearsome military potential that enabled various chario<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>driving peoples, such as the Hittites, to threaten ancient civilizations. Based in Anatolia, the Hittites sacked the city of Babylon in 1595 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> Several centuries later, conflict between the Hittites and Egypt over control of Syria resulted in the world’s first written peace treaty. But chariot technology was portable, and soon both the Egyptians and the Mesopotamians incorporated it into their own military forces. In fact, this powerful military innovation, together with the knowledge of bronze metallurgy, spread quickly and widely, reaching China by 1200 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> There it enabled the creation of a strong Chinese state ruled by the Shang dynasty. All of these developments provide evidence of at least indirect connections across parts of the Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasian landmass in ancient times. Even then, no civilization was wholly isolated from larger patterns of interaction.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_88"><p>88</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0164"><p>In Egypt, the centuries following 1650 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> witnessed the migration of foreigners from surrounding regions and conflict with neighboring peoples, shaking the sense of security that this Nile Valley civilization had long enjoyed. It also stimulated the normally complacent Egyptians to adopt a number of technologies pioneered earlier in Asia, including the horse-drawn chariot; new kinds of armor, bows, daggers, and swords; improved methods of spinning and weaving; new musical instruments; and olive and pomegranate trees. Absorbing these foreign innovations, Egyptians went on to create their own empire, both in Nubia and in the eastern Mediterranean regions of Syria and Palestine. By 1500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, the previously self-contained Egypt became for several centuries an imperial state bridging Africa and Asia, ruling over substantial numbers of non-Egyptian peoples (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch2/STR_02272_02_M03.html" data-target="_pop">Map 2.3</span>). It also became part of an international political system that included the Babylonian and later Assyrian empires of Mesopotamia as well as many other peoples of the region. Egyptian and Babylonian rulers engaged in regular diplomatic correspondence, referred to one another as “brother,” exchanged gifts, and married their daughters into one another’s families. Or at least they tried to. While Babylonian rulers were willing to send their daughters to Egypt, the Egyptians were exceedingly reluctant to return the favor, claiming that “from ancient times the daughter of the king of Egypt has not been given to anyone.” To this rebuff, the disappointed Babylonian monarch replied: “You are a king and you can do as pleases you…. Send me [any] beautiful woman as if she were your daughter. Who is to say this woman is not the daughter of the king?”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-012_23">23</span></p></div>
