</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch22-p041"><p>Beyond these common features of most nationalist movements lay many variations. In some places, that struggle, once begun, produced independence within a few years, four in the case of the Belgian Congo. Elsewhere it was measured in many decades. Nationalism surfaced in Vietnam in the early 1900s, but the country achieved full political independence only in the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>1970s, having fought French colonial rulers, Japanese invaders during World War II, and U.S. military forces in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as Chinese forces during a brief war in 1979. Tactics too varied considerably. In many places, West Africa for example, nationalists relied on peaceful political pressure — demonstrations, strikes, mass mobilization, and negotiations — to achieve independence. Elsewhere armed struggle was required. Eight years of bitter guerrilla warfare preceded Algerian independence from France in 1962.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch22-p042"><p>While all nationalist movements sought political independence for modern states, their ideologies and outlooks also differed. Many in India and the Islamic world viewed their new nations through the prism of religion, while elsewhere more secular outlooks prevailed. In Indonesia, an early nationalist organization, the Islamic Union, appealed on the basis of religion, while later groups espoused Marxism. Indonesia’s primary nationalist leader, Sukarno, sought to embrace and reconcile these various outlooks. “What is Sukarno?” he asked. “A nationalist? An Islamist? A Marxist? … Sukarno is a mixture of all these isms.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch22-sec1-002_3">3</span> Nationalist movements led by communist parties, such as those in Vietnam and China, sought major social transformations as well as freedom from foreign rule, while those in most of Africa focused on ending racial discrimination and achieving political independence with little concern about emerging patterns of domestic class inequality.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch22-p043"><p>Two of the most extended freedom struggles — in India and South Africa — illustrate both the variations and the complexity of this process, which was so central to twentieth-century world history. India was among the first colonies to achieve independence and provided both a model and an inspiration to others, whereas South Africa, though not formally a colony, was among the last to throw off political domination by whites.</p></div>
