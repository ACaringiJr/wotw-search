</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p012"><p>All of these developments give some validity to the notion of an early modern era. But this is far from the whole story, and it may be misleading if it suggests that European world domination and more fully modern societies were a sure thing, an inevitable outgrowth of early modern developments. In fact, that future was far from clear in 1750.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p013"><p>Although Europeans ruled the Americas and controlled the world’s sea routes, their political and military power in mainland Asia and Africa was very limited. Eighteent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century China and Japan strictly controlled the European missionaries and merchants who operated in their societies, and African authorities frequently set the terms under which the slave trade was conducted. Islam, not Christianity, was the most rapidly spreading faith in much of Asia and Africa, and in 1750 Europe, India, and China were roughly comparable in their manufacturing output. In short, it was not obvious that Europeans would soon dominate the planet. Moreover, populations and economies had surged at various points in the past, only to fall back again in a cyclical pattern. Nothing guaranteed that the early modern surge would be any more lasting than the others.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_549"><p>549</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p014"><p>Nor was there much to suggest that anything approaching modern industrial society was on the horizon. Animal and human muscles, wind, and water still provided almost all of the energy that powered human economies. Handicraft techniques of manufacturing had nowhere been displaced by factory-based production or steam power. Long-established elites, not middle-class upstarts, everywhere provided leadership and enjoyed the greatest privileges, while rural peasants, not urban workers, represented the primary social group in the lower classes. Kings and nobles, not parliaments and parties, governed. Female subordination was assumed to be natural almost everywhere. While the texture of patriarchy varied among cultures and fluctuated over time, nowhere had ideas of gender equality taken root. Modern society, with its promise of liberation from ancient inequalities and from mass poverty, hardly seemed around the corner.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p015"><p>Most of the world’s peoples, in fact, continued to live in long-established ways, and their societies operated according to traditional principles. Kings ruled most of Europe, and male landowning aristocrats remained at the top of the social hierarchy. Another change in ruling dynasties occurred in China, while that huge country affirmed Confucian values and a social structure that privileged landowning and office-holding elites, all of them men. Most Indians practiced some form of Hinduism and owed their most fundamental loyalty to local castes, even as South Asia continued its centuries-long incorporation into the Islamic world. The realm of Islam maintained its central role in the Eastern Hemisphere as the Ottoman Empire revived the political fortunes of Islam, and the religion sustained its long-term expansion into Africa and Southeast Asia.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p016"><p>In short, for the majority of humankind, the three centuries between 1450 and 1750 marked less an entry into the modern era than the continuing development of older agrarian societies. It was as much a late agrarian era as an early modern age. Persistent patterns rooted in the past characterized that period, along with new departures and sprouts of modernity. And change was not always in the direction of what we now regard as “modern.” In European, Islamic, and Chinese societies alike, some people urged a return to earlier ways of living and thinking rather than embracing what was new and untried. Although Europeans were increasingly prominent on the world stage, they certainly did not hold all the leading roles in the global drama of these three centuries.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt04-p017"><p>From this mixture of what was new and what was old during the early modern era, the three chapters that follow highlight the changes. <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch13_2.html">Chapter 13</span> turns the spotlight on the new empires of those three centuries — European, Middle Eastern, and Asian. New global patterns of lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>distance trade in spices, sugar, silver, fur, and slaves represent the themes of <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch14_2.html">Chapter 14</span>. New cultural trends — both within the major religious traditions of the world and in the emergence of modern science — come together in <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch15_2.html">Chapter 15</span>. With the benefit of hindsight, we may see many of these developments as harbingers of a modern world to come, but from the viewpoint of 1700 or so, the future was open and uncertain, as it almost always is.</p></div>
