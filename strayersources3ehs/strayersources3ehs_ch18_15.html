</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0139"><p>Beyond the many and varied changes that transformed the working lives of millions in the colonial world lies the difficult and highly controversial question of the overall economic impact of colonial rule on Asian and African societies. Defenders, both then and now, praise it for jum<span data-block_type="nobr">p-</span><wbr/>starting modern economic growth, but numerous critics cite a record of exploitation and highlight the limitations and unevenness of that growth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0140"><p>Amid the continuing debates, three things seem reasonably clear. First, colonial rule served, for better or worse, to further the integration of Asian and African economies into a global network of exchange, now centered in Europe. In many places, that process was well under way before conquest imposed foreign rule, and elsewhere it occurred without formal colonial control. Nonetheless, it is apparent that within the colonial world far more land and labor were devoted to production for the global market at the end of the colonial era than at its beginning. Many colonized groups and individuals benefited from their new access to global markets — Burmese rice farmers and West African cocoa farmers, for example. Others were devastated. In India, larg<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>scale wheat exports to Britain continued unchecked — or even increased — despite a major drought and famine that claimed between 6 and 10 million lives in the late 1870s. A colonial government committed to free market principles declined to interfere with those exports or to provide much by way of relief. One senior official declared it “a mistake to spend so much money to save a lot of black fellows.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch18-sec2-007_25">25</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0141"><p>Second, Europeans could hardly avoid conveying to the colonies some elements of their own modernizing process. It was in their interests to do so, and many felt duty bound to “improve” the societies they briefly governed. Modern administrative and bureaucratic structures facilitated colonial control; communication and transportation infrastructure (railroads, motorways, ports, telegraphs, postal services) moved products to the world market; schools trained the army of intermediaries on which colonial rule depended; and modest health care provisions fulfilled some of the “civilizing mission” to which many Europeans felt committed. These elements of modernization made an appearance, however inadequately, during the colonial era.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0144"><p>Third, nowhere in the colonial world did a major breakthrough to modern industrial society occur. When India became independent after two centuries of colonial rule by the world’s first industrial society, it was still one of the poorest of the world’s developing countries. The British may not have created Indian poverty, but neither did they overcome it to any substantial degree. Scholars continue to debate the reasons for that failure: was it the result of deliberate British policies, or was it due to the conditions of Indian society? The nationalist movements that surged across Asia and Africa in the twentieth century had their own answer. To their many millions of participants, colonial rule, whatever its earlier promise, had become an economic dead end, whereas independence represented a grand opening to new and more hopeful possibilities. Paraphrasing a famous teaching of Jesus, Kwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister of an independent Ghana, declared, “Seek ye first the political kingdom, and all these other things [schools, factories, hospitals, for example] will be added unto you.”</p></div>
