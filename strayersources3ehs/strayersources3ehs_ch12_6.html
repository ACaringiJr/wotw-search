<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p038"><p>What kinds of changes were transforming the societies of the West African Igbo and the North American Iroquois as the fifteenth century unfolded?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p036"><p>Far more numerous than gatherers and hunters were those many peoples who, though fully agricultural, had avoided incorporation into larger empires or civilizations and had not developed their own cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/> or stat<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based societies. Living usually in small villag<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based communities and organized in terms of kinship relations, such people predominated during the fifteenth century in much of North America; in most of the tropical lowlands of South America and the Caribbean; in parts of the Amazon River basin, Southeast Asia, and Africa south of the equator; and throughout Pacific Oceania. Historians have largely relegated such societies to the periphery of world history, viewing them as marginal to the cities, states, and larg<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>scale civilizations that predominate in most accounts of the global past. Viewed from within their own circles, though, these societies were at the center of things, each with its own history of migration, cultural transformation, social conflict, incorporation of new people, political rise and fall, and interaction with strangers. In short, they too changed as their histories took shape.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p039"><p>East of the Niger River in the heavily forested region of West Africa lay the lands of the Igbo (E<span data-block_type="nobr">E-</span><wbr/>boh) peoples. By the fifteenth century, their neighbors, the Yoruba and Bini, had begun to develop small states and urban centers. But the Igbo, whose dense population and extensive trading networks might well have given rise to states, declined to follow suit. The deliberate Igbo preference was to reject the kingship and stat<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>building efforts of their neighbors. They boasted on occasion that “the Igbo have no kings.” Instead, they relied on other institutions to maintain social cohesion beyond the level of the village: title societies in which wealthy men received a series of prestigious ranks, women’s associations, hereditary ritual experts serving as mediators, and a balance of power among kinship groups. It was a “stateless society,” famously described in Chinua Achebe’s <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, the most widely read novel to emerge from twentiet<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century Africa.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_503"><p>503</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p040"><p>But the Igbo peoples and their neighbors did not live in isolated, self-contained societies. They traded actively among themselves and with more distant peoples, such as the large African kingdom of Songhay (sahn-GEYE) far to the north. Cotton cloth, fish, copper and iron goods, decorative objects, and more drew neighboring peoples into networks of exchange. Common artistic traditions reflected a measure of cultural unity in a politically fragmented region, and all of these peoples seem to have changed from a matrilineal to a patrilineal system of tracing their descent. Little of this registered in the larger civilizations of the Afro-Eurasian world, but to the peoples of the West African forest during the fifteenth century, these processes were central to their history and their daily lives. Soon, however, all of them would be caught up in the transatlantic slave trade and would be changed substantially in the process.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p041"><p>Across the Atlantic in what is now central New York State, other agricultural village societies were also in the process of substantial change during the several centuries preceding their incorporation into European trading networks and empires. The Iroquois-speaking peoples of that region had only recently become fully agricultural, adopting maize- and bean-farming techniques that had originated centuries earlier in Mesoamerica. As this productive agriculture took hold by 1300 or so, the population grew, the size of settlements increased, and distinct peoples emerged. Frequent warfare also erupted among them. Some scholars have speculated that as agriculture, largely seen as women’s work, became the primary economic activity, “warfare replaced successful food getting as the avenue to male prestige.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch12-sec2-002_2">2</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p042"><p>Whatever caused it, this increased level of conflict among Iroquois peoples triggered a remarkable political innovation around the fifteenth century: a loose alliance or confederation among five Iroquois-speaking peoples — the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. Based on an agreement known as the Great Law of Peace (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch12/STR_02272_12_M05.html" data-target="_pop">Map 12.5</span>), the Five Nations, as they called themselves, agreed to settle their differences peacefully through a confederation council of clan leaders, some fifty of them altogether, who had the authority to adjudicate disputes and set reparation payments. Operating by consensus, the Iroquois League of Five Nations effectively suppressed the blood feuds and tribal conflicts that had only recently been so widespread. It also coordinated their peoples’ relationship with outsiders, including the Europeans, who arrived in growing numbers in the centuries after 1500.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_504"><p>504</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p043"><p>The Iroquois League gave expression to values of limited government, social equality, and personal freedom, concepts that some European colonists found highly attractive. One British colonial administrator declared in 1749 that the Iroquois had “such absolute Notions of Liberty that they allow no Kind of Superiority of one over another, and banish all Servitude from their Territories.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch12-sec2-002_3">3</span> Such equality extended to gender relationships, for among the Iroquois, descent was matrilineal (reckoned through the woman’s line), married couples lived with the wife’s family, and women controlled agriculture and property. While men were hunters, warriors, and the primary political officeholders, women selected and could depose those leaders.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch12-p044"><p>Wherever they lived in 1500, over the next several centuries independent agricultural peoples such as the Iroquois and Igbo were increasingly encompassed in expanding economic networks and conquest empires based in Western Europe, Russia, China, or India. In this respect, they replicated the experience of many other village-based farming communities that had much earlier found themselves forcibly included in the powerful embrace of Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Roman, Indian, Chinese, and other civilizations.</p></div>
