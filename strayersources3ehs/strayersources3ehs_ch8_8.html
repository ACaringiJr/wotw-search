<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p035x"><p>An important topic across world history is how civilizations responded to outside groups, as illustrated here with the response of China’s governments to northern nomads.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p061"><p>From early times to the nineteenth century, China’s many interactions with a larger Eurasian world shaped both China’s own development and that of world history more generally. The country’s most enduring and intense interaction with foreigners lay to the north, involving the many nomadic pastoral or sem<span data-block_type="nobr">i-</span><wbr/>agricultural peoples of the steppes. Living in areas unable to sustain Chines<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>style farming, the northern nomads had long focused their economies around the raising of livestock (sheep, cattle, goats) and the mastery of horse riding. Organized locally in small, mobile, kinshi<span data-block_type="nobr">p-</span><wbr/>based groups, sometimes called tribes, these peoples also periodically created much larger and powerful states or confederations that could draw on the impressive horsemanship and military skills of virtually the entire male population of their societies. Such specialized pastoral societies needed grain and other agricultural products from China, and their leaders developed a taste for Chinese manufactured and luxury goods — wine and silk, for example — with which they could attract and reward followers. Thus the nomads were drawn like a magnet toward China, trading, raiding, and extorting to obtain the resources so vital to their way of life. For 2,000 years or more, pressure from the steppes and the intrusion of nomadic peoples were constant factors in China’s historical development.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p063"><p>How did the Chinese and their nomadic neighbors to the north view each other?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch08-p064"><p>From the nomads’ point of view, the threat often came from the Chinese, who periodically directed their own military forces deep into the steppes, built the Great Wall to keep the nomads out, and often proved unwilling to allow pastoral peoples easy access to trading opportunities within China. And yet the Chinese needed the nomads. Their lands were the source of horses, which were essential for the Chinese military. Other products of the steppes and the forests beyond, such as skins, furs, hides, and amber, were also of value in China. Furthermore, pastoral nomads controlled much of the Silk Road trading network, which funneled goods from the West into China. The continuing interaction between China and the northern nomads brought together peoples occupying different environments, practicing different economies, governing themselves with different institutions, and thinking about the world in quite different ways.</p></div>
