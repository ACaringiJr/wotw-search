</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0120"><p>If economic life in European empires varied greatly from place to place, even within the same colony, it also offered a different combination of opportunities and hardships to women than it did to men, as the experience of colonial Africa shows.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch18-sec2-006_22">22</span> In precolonial Africa, women were almost everywhere active farmers, with responsibility for planting, weeding, and harvesting in addition to food preparation and child care. Men cleared the land, built houses, herded the cattle, and in some cases assisted with field work. Within this division of labor, women were expected to feed their own families and were usually allocated their own fields for that purpose. Many were also involved in local trading activity. Though clearly subordinate to men, African women nevertheless had a measure of economic autonomy.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0123"><p>How were the lives of African women altered by colonial economies?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0121"><p>As the demands of the colonial economy grew, women’s lives increasingly diverged from those of men. In colonies where cas<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>crop agriculture was dominant, men often withdrew from subsistence production in favor of more lucrative export crops. Among the Ewe people of southern Ghana, men almost completely dominated the highly profitable cacao farming, whereas women assumed near total responsibility for domestic food production. In neighboring Ivory Coast, women had traditionally grown cotton for their families’ clothing, but when that crop acquired a cash value, men insisted that cotton grown for export be produced on their own personal fields. Thus men acted to control the most profitable aspects of cas<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>crop agriculture and in doing so greatly increased the subsistence workload of women. One study from Cameroon estimated that women’s working hours increased from fort<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>six per week in precolonial times to more than seventy by 1934.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0124"><p>Further increasing women’s workload and differentiating their lives from those of men was labor migration. As growing numbers of men sought employment in the cities, on settler farms, or in the mines, their wives were left to manage the domestic economy almost alone. In many cases, women also had to supply food to men in the cities to compensate for very low urban wages. They often took over such traditionally male tasks as breaking the ground for planting, milking the cows, and supervising the herds, in addition to their normal responsibilities. In South Africa, where the demands of the European economy were particularly heavy, some 40 to 50 percent of abl<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>bodied adult men were absent from the rural areas, and women headed 60 percent of households. In Botswana, which supplied much male labor to South Africa, married couples by the 1930s rarely lived together for more than two months at a time. Increasingly, men and women lived in different worlds, with one focused on the cities and working for wages and the other on village life and subsistence agriculture. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch18_14.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Wanjiku of Kenya</span>).</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0136"><p>Women coped with these difficult circumstances in a number of ways. Many sought closer relations with their families of birth rather than with their absent husbands’ families, as would otherwise have been expected. Among the Luo of Kenya, women introduced laborsaving crops, adopted new farm implements, and earned some money as traders. In the cities, they established a variety of self-help associations, including those for prostitutes and for brewers of beer.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_811"><p>811</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0137"><p>The colonial economy sometimes provided a measure of opportunity for enterprising women, particularly in small-scale trade and marketing. In some parts of West Africa, women came to dominate this sector of the economy by selling foodstuffs, cloth, and inexpensive imported goods, while men or foreign firms controlled the more profitable wholesale and import-export trade. Such opportunities sometimes gave women considerable economic autonomy. By the 1930s, for example, Nupe women in northern Nigeria had gained sufficient wealth as itinerant traders that they were contributing more to the family income than their husbands and frequently lent money to them. Among some Igbo groups in southern Nigeria, men were responsible for growing the prestigious yams, but women’s crops — especially cassava — came to have a cash value during the colonial era, and women were entitled to keep the profits from selling them. “What is man? I havemy own money” was a popular saying that expressed the growing economic independence of such women.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch18-sec2-006_24">24</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_812"><p>812</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch18-p0138"><p>At the other end of the social scale, women of impoverished rural families, by necessity, often became virtually independent heads of household in the absence of their husbands. Others took advantage of new opportunities in mission schools, towns, and mines to flee the restrictions of rural patriarchy. Such challenges to patriarchal values elicited various responses from men, including increased accusations of witchcraft against women and fears of impotence. Among the Shona in Southern Rhodesia, and no doubt elsewhere, senior African men repeatedly petitioned the colonial authorities for laws and regulations that would criminalize adultery and restrict women’s ability to leave their rural villages. The control of women’s sexuality and mobility was a common interest of European and African men.</p></div>
