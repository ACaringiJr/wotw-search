</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0103"><p>Far more than the Moche and other coastal civilizations, the interior empires of Wari (wa<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>ree) and Tiwanaku provided a measure of political integration and cultural commonality for the entire Andean region. Growing out of ancient settlements, these two states flourished between 400 and 1000 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, Wari in the northern highlands and Tiwanaku to the south. Both were centered in large urban capitals, marked by monumental architecture and stratified populations numbering in the tens of thousands. Both governments collected surplus food in warehouses as an insurance against times of drought and famine.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0106"><p>What was the significance of Wari and Tiwanaku in the history of Andean civilization?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0104"><p>But neither state controlled a continuous band of territory. Adapting to their vertical environment, both empires established colonies at lower elevations on the eastern and western slopes of the Andes as well as throughout the highlands, seeking access to resources such as seafood, maize, chili peppers, cocoa, hallucinogenic plants, obsidian, and feathers from tropical birds. Caravans of llamas linked distant centers, allowing the exchange and redistribution of goods, while the religious prestige and ceremonial power of the capital city provided further integration. Cultural influences from the center, such as styles of pottery and textiles, spread well beyond the regions of direct political control. Similar religious symbols and images prevailed in both places, including the ancient Andean Staff God, a deity portrayed with a staff in each hand. Versions of this image have been found in Norte Chico, Chavín, and Moche sites as well, suggesting a lon<span data-block_type="nobr">g-</span><wbr/>term continuity in the religious culture of the Andean region.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0107"><p>But Wari and Tiwanaku were hardly carbon copies of each other. Wari’s agriculture employed an elaborate system of hillside terracing and irrigation, using snowmelt from the Andes. A seventeent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century Jesuit missionary thought the hillsides of the Wari region “were covered with flights of stairs.” Tiwanaku’s highly productive farming economy, by contrast, utilized a “raised field” system in which artificially elevated planting surfaces in swampy areas were separated by small irrigation canals. Tiwanaku, furthermore, has become famous for its elaborately fitted stone walls and buildings, while Wari’s tombs and temples were built of fieldstone set in mud mortar and covered with smooth plaster. Cities in the Wari region seemed built to a common plan and linked to the capital by a network of highways, which suggests a political system more tightly controlled from the center than in Tiwanaku.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch06-sec2-008_10">10</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0108"><p>Despite these differences and a 300-mile common border, little overt conflict or warfare occurred between Wari and Tiwanaku. In areas where the two peoples lived near one another, they apparently did not mingle much. They each spoke their own language, wore different clothing, furnished their homes with distinctive goods, and looked to their respective capital cities for inspiration.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch06-p0117"><p>In the several centuries following 1000 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, both civilizations collapsed, their impressive cities permanently abandoned. What followed was a series of smaller kingdoms, one of which evolved into the Inca Empire that gave to Andean civilization a final and spectacular expression before all of the Americas was swallowed up in European empires from across the sea. The Incas themselves clearly drew on the legacy of Wari and Tiwanaku, adopting aspects of their imperial models and systems of statecraft, building on the Wari highway system, and utilizing similar styles of dress and artistic expression. Such was the prestige of Tiwanaku centuries after its collapse that the Incas claimed it as their place of origin.</p></div>
