<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p081"><p>What is the difference between varna and jati as expressions of caste?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p079"><p>As the varna system took shape in India, another set of social distinctions also arose, based largely on occupations. In India as elsewhere, urba<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>based civilization gave rise to specialized occupations, many organized in guilds that regulated their own affairs in a particular region. Over time, these occupationally based groups, known as <em>jatis</em>, blended with the varna system to create India’s unique cast<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>based society.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p082"><p>The many thousands of jatis became the primary cell of India’s social life beyond the family or household, but each of them was associated with one of the great classes (varnas). Thus Brahmins were divided into many separate jatis, or subcastes, as were each of the other varnas as well as the untouchables. In a particular region or village, each jati was ranked in a hierarchy known to all, from the highest of the Brahmins to the lowest of the untouchables. Marriage and eating together were permitted only within an individual’s own jati. Each jati was associated with a particular set of duties, rules, and obligations, which defined its members’ unique and separate place in the larger society. Brahmins, for example, were forbidden to eat meat, while Kshatriyas were permitted to do so. Uppe<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>caste women covered their breasts, while some lowe<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>caste women were forbidden this privilege as a sign of their subordination. “It is better to do one’s own duty badly than another’s well” — this frequently quoted saying summed up the underlying idea of Indian society. With its many separate, distinct, and hierarchically ranked social groups, Indian society was quite different from that of China or the Grec<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Roman world. It was also unique in the set of ideas that explained and justified that social system. Foremost among them was the notion of ritual purity and pollution applied to caste groups. Brahmins or other hig<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>caste people who came in contact with members of lower castes, especially those who cleaned latrines, handled corpses, or butchered and skinned dead animals, were in great danger of being polluted, or made ritually unclean. Thus untouchables were forbidden to use the same wells or to enter the temples designated for highe<span data-block_type="nobr">r-</span><wbr/>caste people. Sometimes they were required to wear a wooden clapper to warn others of their approach. A great body of Indian religious writing defined various forms of impurity and the ritual means of purification.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p086"><p>A further support for this idea of inherent inequality and permanent difference derived from emerging Hindu notions of <em>karma</em>, <em>dharma</em>, and rebirth. Being born into a particular caste was generally regarded as reflecting the good or bad deeds (karma) of a previous life. Thus an individual’s prior actions were responsible for his or her current status. Any hope for rebirth in a higher caste rested on the faithful and selfless performance of one’s present caste duties (dharma) in this life. Doing so contributed to spiritual progress by subduing the relentless demands of the ego. Such teachings, like that of permanent impurity, provided powerful sanctions for the inequalities of Indian society. So too did the threat of social ostracism, because each jati had the authority to expel members who violated its rules. No greater catastrophe could befall a person than this, for it meant the end of any recognized social life and the loss of all social support.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p087"><p>As caste restrictions tightened, it became increasingly difficult — virtually impossible — for individuals to raise their social status during their lifetimes. However, another kind of upward mobility enabled entire jatis, over several generations, to raise their standing in the local hierarchy of caste groups. By acquiring land or wealth, by adopting the behaviors of higher-caste groups, by finding some previously overlooked “ancestor” of a higher caste, a particular jati might slowly be redefined in a higher category. India’s caste system was in practice rather more fluid and changing than the theory of caste might suggest.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch05-p088"><p>India’s social system thus differed from that of China in several ways. It gave priority to religious status and ritual purity (the Brahmins), whereas China elevated political officials to the highest of elite positions. The caste system divided Indian society into vast numbers of distinct social groups; China had fewer, but broader, categories of society — scholar-gentry, landlords, peasants, merchants. Finally, India’s caste society defined these social groups far more rigidly than in China and provided even less opportunity for social mobility.</p></div>
