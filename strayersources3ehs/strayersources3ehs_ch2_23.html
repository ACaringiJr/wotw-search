</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0165"><p>In examining the cultures of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, we are worlds away from life in agricultural villages or Paleolithic camps. Much the same holds for those of the Indus Valley, Central Asia, China, Mesoamerica, and the Andes. Strangely enough, historians have been somewhat uncertain as to how to refer to these new forms of human community. Following common practice, we have called them “civilizations,” but scholars have reservations about the term for two reasons. The first is its implication of superiority. In popular usage, “civilization” suggests refined behavior, a “higher” form of society, something unreservedly positive. The opposite of “civilized” — “barbarian,” “savage,” or “uncivilized” — is normally understood as an insult implying inferiority. That, of course, is precisely how the inhabitants of many civilizations have viewed outsiders, particularly those neighboring peoples living without the alleged benefit of cities and states.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_89"><p>89</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0166"><p>Modern assessments of the First Civilizations reveal a profound ambiguity about these new, larger, and more complex societies. On the one hand, these civilizations have given us inspiring art, profound reflections on the meaning of life, more productive technologies, increased control over nature, and the art of writing — all of which have been cause for celebration. On the other hand, as anthropologist Marvin Harris noted, “human beings learned for the first time how to bow, grovel, kneel, and kowtow.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec1-005_24">24</span> Massive inequalities, state oppression, slavery, large-scale warfare, the subordination of women, and epidemic disease also accompanied the rise of civilization, generating discontent, rebellion, and sometimes the urge to escape. This ambiguity about the character of civilizations has led some historians to avoid the word, referring to early Egypt, Mesopotamia, and other regions instead as complex societies, urban-based societies, state-organized societies, or some other more neutral term.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0167"><p>A second reservation about using the term “civilization” derives from its implication of solidity — the idea that civilizations represent distinct and widely shared identities with clear boundaries that mark them off from other such units. It is unlikely, however, that many people living in Mesopotamia, Norte Chico, or ancient China felt themselves part of a shared culture. Local identities defined by occupation, clan affiliation, village, city, or region were surely more important for most people than those of some larger civilization. At best, members of an educated upper class who shared a common literary tradition may have felt themselves part of some more inclusive civilization, but that left out most of the population. Moreover, unlike modern nations, none of the earlier civilizations had definite borders. Any identification with that civilization surely faded as distance from its core region increased. Finally, the line between civilizations and other kinds of societies is not always clear. Just when does a village or town become a city? At what point does a chiefdom become a state? Scholars continue to argue about these distinctions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p0168"><p>Given these reservations, should historians discard the notion of civilization? Maybe so, but this book continues to use it both because it is so deeply embedded in our way of thinking about the world and because no alternative concept has achieved widespread acceptance for making distinctions among different kinds of human communities. But it is important to recall that historians use “civilization” as a purely descriptive term, referring to a particular and distinctive type of human society — one with cities and states — without implying any judgment or assessment, any sense of superiority or inferiority. Furthermore “civilization” serves to define broad cultural patterns in particular geographic regions — Mesopotamia, the Peruvian coast, or China, for example — even though many people living in those regions may have been more aware of differences and conflicts than of those commonalities.</p></div>
