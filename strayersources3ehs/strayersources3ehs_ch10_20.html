<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0139"><p>As the civilization of the West evolved, it was clearly less developed in comparison to Byzantium, China, India, and the Islamic world. Europe’s cities were smaller, its political authorities weaker, its economy less commercialized, and its technology inferior. Muslim observers who encountered Europeans saw them as barbarians. An Arab geographer of the tenth century commented on Europeans: “Their bodies are large, their manners harsh, their understanding dull, and their tongues heavy…. Those of them who are farthest to the north are the most subject to stupidity, grossness and brutishness.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-011_24">24</span> Muslim travelers over the next several centuries saw more to be praised in West African kingdoms, where Islam was practiced and gold was plentiful.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0140"><p>Furthermore, thoughtful Europeans who directly encountered other peoples often acknowledged their own comparative backwardness. “In our time,” wrote a twelfth-century European scholar, “it is in Toledo [a Spanish city long under Muslim rule] that the teaching of the Arabs … is offered to the crowds. I hastened there to listen to the teaching of the wisest philosophers of this world.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-011_25">25</span> The Italian traveler Marco Polo in the thirteenth century proclaimed Hangzhou in China “the finest and noblest [city] in the world.” In the early sixteenth century, Spanish invaders of Mexico were stunned at the size and wealth of the Aztec capital, especially its huge market, claiming that they “had never seen such a thing before.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-011_26">26</span></p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0143"><p>Curious about the rest of the world, Europeans proved quite willing to engage with and borrow from the more advanced civilizations to the east. Growing European economies, especially in the northwest, reconnected with the Eurasian trading system, with which they had lost contact after the fall of Rome. Now European elites eagerly sought spices, silks, porcelain, and sugar from afar even as they assimilated various technological, intellectual, and cultural innovations, as <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_european_borrowing.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot: European Borrowing</span> demonstrates. When the road to China opened in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, many Europeans, including the merchan<span data-block_type="nobr">t-</span><wbr/>traveler Marco Polo, were more than willing to make the long and difficult journey, returning with amazing tales of splendor and abundance far beyond what was available in Europe. When Europeans took to the oceans in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they were seeking out the sources of African and Asian wealth. Thus the accelerating growth of European civilization was accompanied by its reintegration into the larger Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasian networks of exchange and communication.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0144"><p>In this willingness to borrow, Europe resembled several other thir<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>wave civilizations of the time. Japan, for example, took much from China; West Africa drew heavily on Islamic civilization; and Russia actively imitated Byzantium. All of them were then developing civilizations, in a position analogous perhaps to the developing countries of the twentieth century.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0145"><p>Technological borrowing required adaptation to the unique conditions of Europe and was accompanied by considerable independent invention as well. Together these processes generated a significant tradition of technological innovation that allowed Europe by 1500 to catch up with, and in some areas perhaps to surpass, China and the Islamic world. That achievement bears comparison with the economic revolution of Tang and Song dynasty China, although Europe began at a lower level and depended more on borrowing than did its Chinese counterpart (see <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch8_2.html">Chapter 8</span>). But in the several centuries surrounding 1000, at both ends of Eurasia, major processes of technological innovation were under way.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0148"><p>In Europe, technological breakthroughs first became apparent in agriculture as Europeans adapted to the very different environmental conditions north of the Alps in the several centuries following 500 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span> They developed a heavy wheeled plow that could handle the dense soils of Northern Europe far better than the light, or “scratch,” plow used in Mediterranean agriculture. To pull the plow, Europeans began to rely increasingly on horses rather than oxen and to use iron horseshoes and a more efficient collar, which probably originated in China or Central Asia and could support much heavier loads. In addition, Europeans developed a new three-field system of crop rotation, which allowed considerably more land to be planted at any one time. These were the technological foundations for a more productive agriculture that could support the growing population of European civilization, especially in its urban centers, far more securely than before.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0149"><p>Beyond agriculture, Europeans began to tap non-animal sources of energy in a major way, particularly after 1000. A new type of windmill, very different from an earlier Persian version, was widely used in Europe by the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The water-driven mill was even more important. The Romans had used such mills largely to grind grain, but their development was limited, since few streams flowed all year and many slaves were available to do the work. By the ninth century, however, watermills were rapidly becoming more evident in Europe. In the early fourteenth century, a concentration of sixty-eight mills dotted a one-mile stretch of the Seine River near Paris. In addition to grinding grain, these mills provided power for sieving flour, tanning hides, making beer, sawing wood, manufacturing iron, and making paper. Devices such as cranks, flywheels, camshafts, and complex gearing mechanisms, when combined with water or wind power, enabled Europeans of the High Middle Ages to revolutionize production in a number of industries and to break with the ancient tradition of depending almost wholly on animal or human muscle as sources of energy. So intense was the interest of European artisans and engineers in tapping mechanical sources of energy that a number of them experimented with perpetual-motion machines, an idea borrowed from Indian philosophers.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0150"><p>Technological borrowing was also evident in the arts of war. Gunpowder was invented in China, but Europeans were probably the first to use it in cannons, in the early fourteenth century, and by 1500 they had the most advanced arsenals in the world. In 1517, one Chinese official, on first encountering European ships and weapons, remarked with surprise, “The westerns are extremely dangerous because of their artillery. No weapon ever made since memorable antiquity is superior to their cannon.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-011_27">27</span> Advances in shipbuilding and navigational techniques — including the magnetic compass and sternpost rudder from China and adaptations of the Mediterranean or Arab lateen sail, which enabled vessels to sail against the wind — provided the foundation for European mastery of the seas.</p></div>
