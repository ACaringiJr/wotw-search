</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p095"><p>Within these new kingdoms, a highly fragmented and decentralized society widely known as feudalism emerged with great local variation. In thousands of independent, sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>sufficient, and largely isolated landed estates or manors, power — political, economic, and social — was exercised by a warrior elite of landowning lords. In the constant competition of these centuries, lesser lords and knights swore allegiance to greater lords or kings and thus became their vassals, frequently receiving lands and plunder in return for military service.</p></div>

<h3 data-type="title" data-for_type="box" data-title-for="strayersources3ehs-ch10-bx1-001r">AP® EXAM TIP</h3>
<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p035r"><p>Knowledge of relationships between governments and belief systems is important for success on the AP<sup>®</sup> exam.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p096"><p>Such reciprocal ties between superior and subordinate were also apparent at the bottom of the social hierarchy, as Roman-style slavery gradually gave way to serfdom. Unlike slaves, serfs were not the personal property of their masters, could not be arbitrarily thrown off their land, and were allowed to live in families. However, they were bound to their masters’ estates as peasant laborers and owed various payments and services to the lord of the manor. One family on a manor near Paris in the ninth century owed four silver coins, wine, wood, three hens, and fifteen eggs per year. Women generally were required to weave cloth and make clothing for the lord, while men labored in the lord’s fields. In return, the serf family received a small farm and such protection as the lord could provide. In a violent and insecure world adjusting to the absence of Roman authority, the only security available to many individuals or families lay in these communities, where the ties to kin, manor, and lord constituted the primary human loyalties. It was a world apart from the stability of life in imperial Rome or its continuation in Byzantium.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p097"><p>Also filling the vacuum left by the collapse of empire was the Church, later known as Roman Catholic, yet another link to the now-defunct Roman world. Its hierarchical organization of popes, bishops, priests, and monasteries was modeled on that of the Roman Empire and took over some of its political, administrative, educational, and welfare functions. Latin continued as the language of the Church even as it gave way to various vernacular languages in common speech. In fact, literacy in the classical languages of Greek and Latin remained the hallmark of educated people in the West well into the twentieth century.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p035s"><p>Note these comparisons between Buddhism and Christianity and their relationships with governments in China and Western Europe.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p098"><p>Like the Buddhist establishment in China, the Church subsequently became quite wealthy, with reformers often accusing it of forgetting its central spiritual mission. It also provided a springboard for the conversion of Europe’s many “pagan” peoples. Numerous missionaries, commissioned by the pope, monasteries, or already-converted rulers, fanned out across Europe, generally pursuing a “top-down” strategy. Frequently it worked, as local kings and warlords found status and legitimacy in association with a literate and “civilized” religion that still bore something of the grandeur that was Rome. With “the wealth and protection of the powerful,” ordinary people followed their rulers into the fold of the Church.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-008_15">15</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p099"><p>This process was similar to Buddhism’s appeal for the nomadic rulers of northern and western China following the collapse of the Han dynasty. Christianity, like Buddhism, also bore the promise of superior supernatural powers, and its spread was frequently associated with reported miracles of healing, rainfall, fertility, and victory in battle.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0100"><p>But it was not an easy sell. Outright coercion was sometimes part of the process. More often, however, softer methods prevailed. The Church proved willing to accommodate a considerable range of earlier cultural practices, absorbing them into an emerging Christian tradition. For example, amulets and charms to ward off evil became medals with the image of Jesus or the Virgin Mary; traditionally sacred wells and springs became the sites of churches; and festivals honoring ancient gods became Christian holy days. December 25 was selected as the birthday of Jesus, for it was associated with the winter solstice, the coming of more light, and the birth or rebirth of various deities in pre-Christian European traditions. By 1100, most of Europe had embraced Christianity. Even so, for centuries priests and bishops had to warn their congregations against the worship of rivers, trees, and mountains, and for many people, ancient gods, monsters, trolls, and spirits still inhabited the land. The spreading Christian faith, like the new political framework of European civilization, was a blend of many elements. (For more on the rooting of Christianity in Western Europe, see <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencethemakingofchristianeurope" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence: The Making of Christian Europe</span>.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch10-p0101"><p>Church authorities and the nobles/warriors who exercised political influence reinforced each other. Rulers provided protection for the papacy and strong encouragement for the faith. In return, the Church offered religious legitimacy for the powerful and the prosperous. “It is the will of the Creator,” declared the teaching of the Church, “that the higher shall always rule over the lower. Each individual and class should stay in its place [and] perform its tasks.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch10-sec2-008_16">16</span> But Church and political authorities competed as well as cooperated, for they were rival centers of power in post-Roman Europe. Particularly controversial was the right to appoint bishops and the pope himself; this issue, known as the investiture conflict, was especially prominent in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Was the right to make such appointments the responsibility of the Church alone, or did kings and emperors also have a role? In the compromise that ended the conflict, the Church won the right to appoint its own officials, while secular rulers retained an informal and symbolic role in the process.</p></div>
