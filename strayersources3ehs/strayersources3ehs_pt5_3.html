</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="po-txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p013"><p>The unprecedented power that Europeans accumulated during the long nineteenth century included the ability to rewrite geography and history in ways that centered the human story on Europe and to convey those views powerfully to other people. Thus flat maps placed Europe at the center of the world, while dividing Asia in half. Europe was granted continental status, even though it was more accurately only the western peninsula of Asia, much as India was its southern peninsula. Other regions of the world, such as the Far East or the Near (Middle) East, were defined in terms of their distance from Europe. The entire world came to measure longitude from a line, known as the prime meridian, which passes through the Royal Astronomical Observatory in Greenwich, England.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p014"><p>History textbooks as well often reflected a Europ<span data-block_type="nobr">e-</span><wbr/>centered outlook, sometimes blatantly. In 1874, the American author William O. Swinton wrote <em>An Outline of the World’s History</em>, a book intended for use in high school and college classes, in which he flatly declared that “the race to which we belong, the Aryan, has always played the leading part in the great drama of the world’s progress.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-pt05-sec2-001_1">1</span> Other peoples and civilizations, by contrast, were long believed to be static or stagnant, thus largely lacking any real history. Most Europeans assumed that these “backward” peoples and regions must either imitate the Western model or face further decline and possible extinction. Until the mi<span data-block_type="nobr">d-</span><wbr/>twentieth century, such ideas went largely unchallenged in the Western world. They implied that history was a race toward the finish line of modernity. The fact that Europeans arrived there first seemed to suggest something unique, special, or superior about them or their culture, while everyone else struggled to overcome their inadequacy and catch up.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_691"><p>691</p></div>
<div data-block_type="po-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-pt05-p015"><p>As the discipline of world history took shape in the decades after World War II, scholars and teachers actively sought to counteract such Eurocentric understandings of the past, but they faced a special problem in dealing with recent centuries. How can we avoid Eurocentrism when dealing with a phase of world history in which Europeans were in fact central? The long nineteenth century, after all, was “the European moment,” a time when Europeans were clearly the most powerful, most innovative, most prosperous, most expansive, and most widely imitated people on the planet.</p></div>
