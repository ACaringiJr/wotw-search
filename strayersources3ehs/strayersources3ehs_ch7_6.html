<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p036"><p>During prosperous times especially, a vast array of goods (detailed in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/snapshot/snapshot_economic_exchange_along_the_silk_roads.html" data-target="_pop">Snapshot: Economic Exchange along the Silk Roads</span>) made its way across the Silk Roads, often carried in large camel caravans that traversed the harsh and dangerous steppes, deserts, and oases of Central Asia. In high demand and hard to find, most of these goods were luxury products, destined for an elite and wealthy market, rather than staple goods, for only readily moved commodities of great value could compensate for the high costs of transportation across such long and forbidding distances.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p037"><p>Of all these luxury goods, it was silk that came to symbolize this Eurasian network of exchange. From the time of silk’s origin in China, by 3000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> or earlier, that civilization long held a monopoly on its production. After 300 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> or so, that precious fabric increasingly found a growing market all across the linked commercial network of the Afr<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>Eurasian world. Although the silk trade itself was largely in the hands of men, women figured hugely in the process in terms of both supply and demand. For many centuries, Chinese women, mostly in rural areas, were responsible for every step of the ingenious and laborious enterprise of silk production. They tended the mulberry trees on whose leaves silkworms fed; they unwound the cocoons in very hot water to extract the long silk fibers; they turned these fibers into thread and wove them into textiles. Thus Chinese homes became the primary site of textile production with rural women as its main labor force. By the time of the Tang dynasty (618–907 <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>), women were making a large contribution to the household economy, to technological innovation in the silk industry, and to the state, which depended heavily on peasant taxes, often paid in cloth. Despite these contributions, many rural families persisted in poverty, as the thirteent<span data-block_type="nobr">h-</span><wbr/>century writer We<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>hsiang indicated:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p040"><p>Elite Chinese women, and their men as well, also furnished part of the demand for these luxurious fabrics, which marked their high status. So too did Chinese officials, who required huge quantities of silk to exchange for much-needed horses and to buy off “barbarian” invaders from the north. Beyond China, women in many cultures ardently sought Chinese silk for its comfort and its value as a fashion statement. The demand for silk, as well as for cotton textiles from India, was so great in the Roman Empire that various Roman writers were appalled at the drain of resources that it represented. They also were outraged at the moral impact of wearing revealing silk garments. “I can see clothes of silk,” lamented Seneca the Younger in the first century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, “if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one’s decency, can be called clothes…. Wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife’s body.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch07-sec2-002_4">4</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p043"><p>By the sixth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, the knowledge and technology for producing raw silk had spread beyond China. An old Chinese story attributes it to a Chinese princess who smuggled out silkworms in her turban when she was married off to a Central Asian ruler. In a European version of the tale, Christian monks living in China did the deed by hiding some silkworms in a bamboo cane, an act of industrial espionage that allowed an independent silk-producing and silk-weaving industry to take hold in the Byzantine Empire. However it happened, Koreans, Japanese, Indians, and Persians likewise learned how to produce this precious fabric.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p044"><p>As the supply of silk increased, its many varieties circulated even more extensively across Afro-Eurasian trade routes. In Central Asia, silk was used as currency and as a means of accumulating wealth. In both China and the Byzantine Empire, silk became a symbol of high status, and governments passed laws that restricted silk clothing to members of the elite. Furthermore, silk became associated with the sacred in the expanding world religions of Buddhism and Christianity. Chinese Buddhist pilgrims who made their way to India seeking religious texts and relics took with them large quantities of silk as gifts to the monasteries they visited. Buddhist monks in China received purple silk robes from Tang dynasty emperors as a sign of high honor. In the world of Christendom, silk wall hangings, altar covers, and vestments became highly prestigious signs of devotion and piety. Because no independent silk industry developed in Western Europe until the twelfth century <span data-block_type="small">C.E.</span>, a considerable market developed for silks imported from the Islamic world. Ironically, the splendor of Christian churches depended in part on Islamic trading networks and on silks manufactured in the Muslim world. Some of those silks were even inscribed with passages in Arabic from the Quran, unbeknownst to their European buyers.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch07-sec2-002_5">5</span> By the twelfth century, the West African king of Ghana was wearing silk, and that fabric circulated in Egypt, Ethiopia, and along the East African coast as well.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p047"><p>What were the major economic, social, and cultural consequences of Silk Road commerce?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch07-p045"><p>Compared to contemporary global commerce, the volume of trade on the Silk Roads was modest, and its focus on luxury goods limited its direct impact on most people. Nonetheless, it had important economic and social consequences. Peasants in the Yangzi River delta of southern China sometimes gave up the cultivation of food crops, choosing to focus instead on producing silk, paper, porcelain, lacquerware, or iron tools, many of which were destined for the markets of the Silk Roads. In this way, the impact of long-distance trade trickled down to affect the lives of ordinary farmers. Furthermore, favorably placed individuals could benefit immensely from long-distance trade. The twelfth-century Persian merchant Ramisht made a personal fortune from his long-distance trading business and with his profits purchased an enormously expensive silk covering for the Kaaba, the central shrine of Islam in Mecca.</p></div>
