</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p047"><p>The decisive conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires and all that followed from it — disease, population collapse, loss of land to Europeans, forced labor, resettlement into more compact villages — created a setting in which the religion of the victors took hold in Spanish American colonies. Europeans saw their political and military success as a demonstration of the power of the Christian God. Native American peoples generally agreed, and by 1700 or earlier the vast majority had been baptized and saw themselves in some respects as Christians. After all, other conquerors such as the Aztecs and the Incas had always imposed their gods in some fashion on defeated peoples. So it made sense, both practically and spiritually, to affiliate with the Europeans’ God, saints, rites, and rituals. Many millions accepted baptism, contributed to the construction of village churches, attended services, and embraced images of saints. Despite the prominence of the Virgin Mary as a religious figure across Latin America, the cost of conversion was high, especially for women. Many women, who had long served as priests, shamans, or ritual specialists, had no corresponding role in a Catholic church, led by an al<span data-block_type="nobr">l-</span><wbr/>male clergy. And, with a few exceptions, convent life, which had provided some outlet for female authority and education in Catholic Europe, was reserved largely for Spanish women in the Americas. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch15_8.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Úrsula de Jesús</span> for an exception.)</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p050"><p>Earlier conquerors had made no attempt to eradicate local deities and religious practices. The flexibility and inclusiveness of Mesoamerican and Andean religions had made it possible for subject people to accommodate the gods of their new rulers while maintaining their own traditions. But Europeans were different. They claimed an exclusive religious truth and sought the utter destruction of local gods and everything associated with them. Operating within a Spanish colonial regime that actively encouraged conversion, missionaries often proceeded by persuasion and patient teaching. At times, though, their frustration with the persistence of “idolatry, superstition, and error” boiled over into violent campaigns designed to uproot old religions once and for all. In 1535, the bishop of Mexico proudly claimed that he had destroyed 500 pagan shrines and 20,000 idols. During the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, church authorities in the Andean region periodically launched movements of “extirpation,” designed to fatally undermine native religion. They destroyed religious images and ritual objects, publicly urinated on native “idols,” desecrated the remains of ancestors, flogged “idolaters,” and held religious trials and “processions of shame” aimed at humiliating offenders.</p></div>

The central dish on the table was a roasted guinea pig, a traditional sacrificial animal, while a local fermented corn drink called chicha was also part of the meal. Side dishes featured pomegranates, a Eurasian fruit brought to Peru by the Columbian exchange symbolizing the passion of Christ. At the bottom right, looking away from Jesus while grasping a money bag, is the figure of Judas, painted, some say, to resemble Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conqueror of the Inca Empire.</span><span data-block_type="ph-cl">(© Yadid Levy/age fotostock)</span></span></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p060"><p>It is hardly surprising that such aggressive action generated resistance. Writing around 1600, the native Peruvian nobleman Guaman Poma de Ayala commented on the posture of native women toward Christianity: “They do not confess; they do not attend catechism classes … nor do they go to mass…. And resuming their ancient customs and idolatry, they do not want to serve God or the crown.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-003_6">6</span> Occasionally, overt resistance erupted. One such example was the religious revivalist movement in central Peru in the 1560s, known as Taki Onqoy (dancing sickness). Possessed by the spirits of local gods, or <em>huacas</em>, traveling dancers and teachers predicted that an alliance of Andean deities would soon overcome the Christian God, inflict the intruding Europeans with the same diseases that they had brought to the Americas, and restore the world of the Andes to an imagined earlier harmony. They called on native peoples to cut off all contact with the Spanish, to reject Christian worship, and to return to traditional practices. “The world has turned about,” one member declared, “and this time God and the Spaniards [will be] defeated and all the Spaniards killed and their cities drowned; and the sea will rise and overwhelm them, so that there will remain no memory of them.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-003_7">7</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p061"><p>More common than such frontal attacks on Christianity, which colonial authorities quickly smashed, were efforts at blending two religious traditions, reinterpreting Christian practices within an Andean framework, and incorporating local elements into an emerging Andean Christianity. Even female dancers in the Taki Onqoy movement sometimes took the names of Christian saints, seeking to appropriate for themselves the religious power of Christian figures. Within Andean Christian communities, women might offer the blood of a llama to strengthen a village church or make a cloth covering for the Virgin Mary and a shirt for an image of a huaca with the same material. Although the state cults of the Incas faded away, missionary attacks did not succeed in eliminating the influence of local huacas. Images and holy sites might be destroyed, but the souls of the huacas remained, and their representatives gained prestige. One resilient Andean resident inquired of a Jesuit missionary: “Father, are you tired of taking our idols from us? Take away that mountain if you can, since that is the God I worship.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch15-sec2-003_8">8</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p062"><p>In Mexico as well, an immigrant Christianity was assimilated into patterns of local culture. Parishes were organized largely around precolonial towns or regions. Churches built on or near the sites of old temples became the focus of community identity. <em>Cofradias</em>, church-based associations of laypeople, organized community processions and festivals and made provisions for proper funerals and burials for their members. Central to an emerging Mexican Christianity were the saints who closely paralleled the functions of precolonial gods. Saints were imagined as parents of the local community and the true owners of its land, and their images were paraded through the streets on the occasion of great feasts and were collected by individual households. Mexico’s Virgin of Guadalupe neatly combined both Mesoamerican and Spanish notions of Divine Motherhood (see the <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch15/STR_02272_15_P01.html" data-target="_pop">chapter-opening photo</span>). Although parish priests were almost always Spanish, the <em>fiscal</em>, or leader of the church staff, was a native Christian of great local prestige, who carried on the traditions and role of earlier religious specialists.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch15-p063"><p>Throughout the colonial period and beyond, many Mexican Christians also took part in rituals derived from the past, with little sense of incompatibility with Christian practice. Incantations to various gods for good fortune in hunting, farming, or healing; sacrifices of sel<span data-block_type="nobr">f-</span><wbr/>bleeding; offerings to the sun; divination; the use of hallucinogenic drugs — all of these practices provided spiritual assistance in those areas of everyday life not directly addressed by Christian rites. Conversely, these practices also showed signs of Christian influence. Wax candles, normally used in Christian services, might now appear in front of a stone image of a precolonial god. The anger of a neglected saint, rather than that of a traditional god, might explain someone’s illness and require offerings, celebration, or a new covering to regain his or her favor. In such ways did Christianity take root in the new cultural environments of Spanish America, but it was a distinctly Andean or Mexican Christianity, not merely a copy of the Spanish version.</p></div>
