Much studied by archeologists and historians, Sumerian civilization likely gave rise to the world’s earliest written language, which was used initially by officials to record the goods received by various temples. Almost simultaneously, the Nile River valley in northeastern Africa witnessed the emergence of Egyptian civilization, famous for its pharaohs and pyramids, as well as a separate civilization known as Nubia, farther south along the Nile. Unlike the cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states of Sumer, Egyptian civilization took shape as a unified territorial state in which cities were rather less prominent. Later in this chapter, we will compare these two First Civilizations in greater detail.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p033"><p>Less well known and only recently investigated by scholars was a third early civilization that was developing along the central coast of Peru from roughly 3000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> to 1800 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, at about the same time as the civilizations of Egypt and Sumer. This desert region received very little rainfall, but it was punctuated by dozens of rivers that brought the snowmelt of the adjacent Andes Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Along a thirt<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>mile stretch of that coast and in the nearby interior, a series of some twent<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>five urban centers emerged in an area known as Norte Chico, the largest of which was Caral, in the Supe River valley. (See <span data-type="link" data-href="strayersources3ehs_ch2_6.html" data-target="_pop">Zooming In: Caral, a City of Norte Chico</span>.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p034"><p>Norte Chico was a distinctive civilization in many ways. Its cities were smaller than those of Mesopotamia and show less evidence of economic specialization. The economy was based to an unusual degree on an extremely rich fishing industry in anchovies and sardines along the coast. These items apparently were exchanged for cotton, essential for fishing nets, as well as food crops such as squash, beans, and guava, all of which were grown by inland people in the river valleys using irrigation agriculture. Unlike Egyptian and Mesopotamian societies, this Peruvian civilization did not rest on grain-based farming; its people did not develop pottery or writing; and few sculptures, carvings, or drawings have been uncovered so far. Archeologists have, however, found a 5,000-year-old <em>quipu</em> (a series of knotted cords, later used extensively by the Inca for accounting purposes), which some scholars have suggested may have been an alternative form of writing or symbolic communication. Furthermore, the cities of Norte Chico lacked defensive walls, and archeologists have discovered little evidence of warfare, such as burned buildings and mutilated corpses. Norte Chico apparently “lighted a cultural fire” in the Andes and established a pattern for the many Andean civilizations that followed — Chavín, Moche, Wari, Tiwanaku, and Inca.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-001_2">2</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p043"><p>Somewhat later, at least four additional First Civilizations made their appearance. In the Indus and Saraswati river valleys of what is now Pakistan, a remarkable civilization arose during the third millennium <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> By 2000 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, it embraced a far larger area than Mesopotamia, Egypt, or coastal Peru and was expressed primarily in its elaborately planned cities. All across this huge area, common patterns prevailed: standardized weights, measures, architectural styles, even the size of bricks. As elsewhere, irrigated agriculture provided the economic foundation for the civilization, and a written language, thus far undeciphered, provides evidence of a literate culture for the few.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p044"><p>Unlike its Middle Eastern counterparts, the Indus Valley civilization apparently generated no palaces, temples, elaborate graves, kings, or warrior classes. In short, the archeological evidence provides little indication of a political hierarchy or centralized state. This absence of evidence has sent scholars scrambling to provide an explanation for the obvious specialization, coordination, and complexity that the Indus Valley civilization exhibited. A series of small republics, rule by priests, an early form of the caste system — all of these have been suggested as alternative mechanisms of integration in this first South Asian civilization. Although no one knows for sure, the possibility that the Indus Valley may have housed a sophisticated civilization without a corresponding state has excited the imagination of scholars. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidenceindusvalleycivilization" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence: Indus Valley Civilization</span>.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p045"><p>Whatever its organization, the local environmental impact of the Indus Valley civilization, as in many others, was heavy and eventually undermined its ecological foundations. Repeated irrigation increased the amount of salt in the soil and lowered crop yields. The making of mud bricks, dried in ovens, required an enormous amount of wood for fuel, generating large-scale deforestation and soil erosion. Thus environmental degradation contributed significantly to the abandonment of these magnificent cities by about 1700 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> Thereafter, they were largely forgotten, until their rediscovery by archeologists in the twentieth century. Nonetheless, many features of this early civilization — ceremonial bathing, ritual burning, yoga positions, bulls and elephants as religious symbols, styles of clothing and jewelry — continued to nourish the later civilization of the Indian subcontinent. In fact they persist into the present.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-001_3">3</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p046"><p>The early civilization of China, dating to perhaps 2200 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, was very different from that of the Indus Valley. The ideal — if not always the reality — of a centralized state was evident from the days of the Xia (shyah) dynasty (2070–1600 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>), whose legendary monarch Wu organized flood control projects that “mastered the waters and made them to flow in great channels.” Subsequent dynasties — the Shang (1600–1046 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>) and the Zhou (JOH) (1046–771 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>) — substantially enlarged the Chinese state, erected lavish tombs for their rulers, and buried thousands of human sacrificial victims to accompany them in the next world. By the Zhou dynasty, a distinctive Chinese political ideology had emerged, featuring a ruler, known as the Son of Heaven. This monarch served as an intermediary between heaven and earth and ruled by the Mandate of Heaven only so long as he governed with benevolence and maintained social harmony among his people. An early form of written Chinese has been discovered on numerous oracle bones, which were intended to predict the future and to assist China’s rulers in the task of governing. Like Egypt, China has experienced an impressive continuity of identity as a distinct civilization from its earliest expression into modern times.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p047"><p>Central Asia was the site of yet another First Civilization. In the Oxus or Amu Darya river valley and nearby desert oases (what is now northern Afghanistan and southern Turkmenistan), a quite distinctive and separate civilization took shape very quickly after 2200 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> Within two centuries, a number of substantial fortified centers had emerged, containing residential compounds, artisan workshops, and temples, all surrounded by impressive walls and gates. Economically based on irrigation agriculture and stock raising, this Central Asian or Oxus civilization had a distinctive cultural style, expressed in its architecture, ceramics, burial techniques, seals, and more, though it did not develop a literate culture. Evidence for an aristocratic social hierarchy comes from depictions of gods and men in widely differing dress performing various functions from eating at a banquet to driving chariots to carrying heavy burdens. Visitors to this civilization would have found occasional goods from China, India, and Mesopotamia, as well as products from pastoral nomads of the steppe land and the forest dwellers of Siberia. According to a leading historian, this Central Asian civilization was the focal point of a “Eurasian-wide system of intellectual and commercial exchange.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch02-sec2-001_4">4</span> Compared to Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, however, it had a relatively brief history, for by 1700 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, it had faded away as a civilization, at about the same time as a similar fate befell its Indus Valley counterpart. Its cities were abandoned and apparently forgotten until their resurrection by archeologists in the twentieth century. And yet its influence persisted, as elements of this civilization’s cultural style show up much later in Iran, India, and the eastern Mediterranean world.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p048"><p>A final First Civilization, known as the Olmec, took shape around 1200 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico near present-day Veracruz in southern Mexico. Based on an agricultural economy of maize, beans, and squash, Olmec cities arose from a series of competing chiefdoms and became ceremonial centers filled with elaborately decorated temples, altars, pyramids, and tombs of rulers. The most famous artistic legacy of the Olmecs lay in some seventeen colossal basalt heads, weighing twenty tons or more. Recent discoveries suggest that the Olmecs may well have created the first written language in the Americas by about 900 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> Sometimes regarded as the “mother civilization” of Mesoamerica, Olmec civilization generated cultural patterns — mound building, artistic styles, urban planning, a game played with a rubber ball, ritual sacrifice, and bloodletting by rulers — that spread widely throughout the region and influenced subsequent civilizations, such as the Maya and Teotihuacán.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch02-p049"><p>Beyond these seven First Civilizations, other smaller civilizations also flourished. Lying south of Egypt in the Nile Valley, an early Nubian civilization (3400–3200 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>) known as Ta-Seti was clearly distinctive and independent of its northern neighbor, although Nubia was later involved in a long and often contentious relationship with Egypt. Likewise in China, a large city known as Sanxingdui, rich in bronze sculptures and much else, arose separately but at the same time as the more well-known Shang dynasty. As a new form of human society, civilization was beginning its long march toward encompassing almost all of humankind by the twentieth century. At the time, however, these breakthroughs to new forms of culture and society were small islands of innovation in a sea of people living in much older ways.</p></div>
