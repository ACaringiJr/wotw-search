<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p054"><p>Chinese authorities were not passive in the face of their country’s mounting crises, both internal and external. Known as “self-strengthening,” their policies during the 1860s and 1870s sought to reinvigorate a traditional China while borrowing cautiously from the West. An overhauled examination system, designed to recruit qualified candidates for official positions, sought the “good men” who could cope with the massive reconstruction that China faced in the wake of the Taiping rebellion. Support for landlords and the repair of dikes and irrigation helped restore rural social and economic order. A few industrial factories producing textiles and steel were established, coal mines were expanded, and a telegraph system was initiated. One Chinese general in 1863 confessed his humiliation that “Chinese weapons are far inferior to those of foreign countries.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch19-sec2-003_8">8</span> A number of modern arsenals, shipyards, and foreign-language schools sought to remedy this deficiency.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-hd1" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p056"><p><span data-block_type="sq_mrk">▪</span><strong>CONNECTION</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p057"><p>What strategies did China adopt to confront its various problems? In what ways did these strategies reflect China’s own history and culture as well as the new global order?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p055"><p>Self-strengthening as an overall program for China’s modernization was inhibited by the fears of conservative leaders that urban, industrial, or commercial development would erode the power and privileges of the landlord class. Furthermore, the new industries remained largely dependent on foreigners for machinery, materials, and expertise. And they served to strengthen local authorities, who largely controlled those industries, rather than the central Chinese state.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p058"><p>The general failure of “self-strengthening” became apparent at the end of the century, when an antiforeign movement known as the Boxer Uprising (1898–1901) erupted in northern China. Led by militia organizations calling themselves the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, the “Boxers” killed numerous Europeans and Chinese Christians and laid siege to the foreign embassies in Beijing. When Western powers and Japan occupied Beijing to crush the rebellion and imposed a huge payment on China as a punishment, it was clear that China remained a dependent country, substantially under foreign control.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p059"><p>No wonder, then, that growing numbers of educated Chinese, including many in official elite positions, became highly disillusioned with the Qing dynasty, which was both foreign and ineffective in protecting China. By the late 1890s, such people were organizing a variety of clubs, study groups, and newspapers to examine China’s desperate situation and to explore alternative paths. The names of these organizations reflect their outlook — the National Rejuvenation Study Society, Society to Protect the Nation, and Understand the National Shame Society. They admired not only Western science and technology but also Western political practices that limited the authority of the ruler and permitted wider circles of people to take part in public life. They believed that only a truly unified nation in which rulers and ruled were closely related could save China from dismemberment at the hands of foreign imperialists. Despite the small number of women who took part in these discussions, traditional gender roles became yet another focus of opposition. No one expressed that issue more forcefully than Qiu Jin (1875–1907), the rebellious daughter of a gentry family who left a husband and two children to study in Japan. Upon her return to China, she started a women’s journal, arguing that liberated women were essential for a strong Chinese nation, and became involved in revolutionary politics. (For more on Qiu Jin, see <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource193" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 19.3</span>.) Thus was born the immensely powerful force of Chinese nationalism, directed alike against Western imperialists, the foreign Qing dynasty, and aspects of China’s traditional culture.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch19-p060"><p>The Qing dynasty response to these new pressures proved inadequate. A flurry of progressive imperial edicts in 1898, known as the Hundred Days of Reform, was soon squelched by conservative forces. More extensive reform in the early twentieth century, including the end of the old examination system and the promise of a national parliament, was a classic case of too little too late. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencechangingchina19" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence: Changing China</span>.) In 1912 the last Chinese emperor abdicated as the ancient imperial order that had governed China for two millennia collapsed, with only a modest nudge from organized revolutionaries. It was the end of a long era in China and the beginning of an immense struggle over the country’s future.</p></div>
