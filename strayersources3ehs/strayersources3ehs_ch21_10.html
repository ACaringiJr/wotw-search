<div data-block_type="mn-bx3-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p035h"><p>You must remember that most revolutions since the French Revolution have promised some type of land reform.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p071"><p>In their efforts to build socialism, both the Soviet Union and China first expropriated landlords’ estates and redistributed that land on a much more equitable basis to the peasantry. Such actions, although clearly revolutionary, were not socialist, for peasants initially received their land as private property. In Russia, the peasants had spontaneously redistributed the land among themselves, and the victorious Bolsheviks merely ratified their actions. In China after 1949, land reform was a more prolonged and difficult process. Hastily trained teams were dispatched to the newly liberated areas, where they mobilized the poorer peasants in thousands of separate villages to confront and humiliate the landlords or the more wealthy peasants. Their land, animals, tools, houses, and money were then redistributed to the poorer members of the village. In these villages, land reform teams encountered the age-old deference that peasants traditionally had rendered to their social superiors. One young woman activist described the confrontational meetings intended to break this ancient pattern:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p072"><p>“Speak bitterness meetings,” as they were called, would help [the peasants] to understand how things really had been in the old days, to realize that their lives were not blindly ordained by fate … and that far from owing anything to the feudal landlords, it was the feudal landlords who owed them a debt of suffering beyond all reckoning.<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch21-sec2-004_4">4</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p073"><p>It was, as Mao Zedong put it, “not a dinner party.” Approximately 1 to 2 million landlords were killed in the process, which was largely over by 1952.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p075"><p>How did the collectivization of agriculture differ between the USSR and China?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch21-p076"><p>A second and more distinctly socialist stage of rural reform sought to end private property in land by collectivizing agriculture. In China, despite brief resistance from richer peasants, collectivization during the 1950s was a generally peaceful process, owing much to the close relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the peasantry, which had been established during three decades of struggle. This contrasted markedly with the earlier experience of the Soviet Union from 1928 to 1933, when peasants were forced into collective farms and violence was extensive. Russian peasants slaughtered and consumed hundreds of thousands of animals rather than surrender them to the collectives. Stalin singled out the richer peasants, known as <em>kulaks</em> (koo-LAHKS), for exclusion from the new collective farms. Some were killed, and many others were deported to remote areas of the country. With little support or experience in the countryside, Soviet communists, who came mostly from the cities, were viewed as intrusive outsiders in Russian peasant villages. A terrible famine ensued, with some 5 million deaths from starvation or malnutrition. China, however, pushed collectivization even further than the Soviet Union did, particularly in huge “people’s communes” during the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s. It was an effort to mobilize China’s enormous population for rapid development and at the same time to move toward a more fully communist society with an even greater degree of social equality and collective living. (See <span data-type="link" data-href-alias="workingwithevidencesource212" data-href="" data-target="_pop">Working with Evidence, Source 21.2</span>, for more on communes.) Administrative chaos, disruption of marketing networks, and bad weather combined to produce a massive famine that killed an amazing 20 million people or more between 1959 and 1962, dwarfing even the earlier Soviet famine.</p></div>
