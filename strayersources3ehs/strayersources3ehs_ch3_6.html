<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p034"><p>It would be hard to imagine a sharper contrast than that between the huge and centralized Persian Empire, governed by an absolute and almost unapproachable monarch, and the small competing cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states of classical Greece, which allowed varying degrees of popular participation in political life. Like the Persians, the Greeks were an Ind<span data-block_type="nobr">o-</span><wbr/>European people whose early history drew on the legacy of the First Civilizations. The classical Greece of historical fame emerged around 750 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> as a new civilization and flourished for about 400 years before it was incorporated into a succession of foreign empires. During that relatively short period, the civilization of Athens and Sparta, of Plato and Aristotle, of Zeus and Apollo took shape and collided with its giant neighbor to the east.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p035e"><p>Calling themselves Hellenes, the Greeks created a civilization that was distinctive in many ways, particularly in comparison with that of the Persians. The total population of Greece and the Aegean basin was just 2 million to 3 million, a fraction of that of the Persian Empire. Furthermore, Greek civilization took shape on a small peninsula, deeply divided by steep mountains and valleys. Its geography certainly contributed to the political shape of that civilization, which found expression not in a Persia<span data-block_type="nobr">n-</span><wbr/>style empire, but in hundreds of cit<span data-block_type="nobr">y-</span><wbr/>states or small settlements (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/img_ch3/STR_02272_03_M02.html" data-target="_pop">Map 3.2</span>). Most were quite modest in size, with between 500 and 5,000 male citizens. But Greek civilization, like its counterparts elsewhere, also left a decisive environmental mark on the lands it encompassed. Smelting metals such as silver, lead, copper, bronze, and iron required enormous supplies of wood, leading to deforestation and soil erosion. Plato declared that the area around Athens had become “a mere relic of the original country…. All the rich soil has melted away, leaving a country of skin and bone.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec2-002_5">5</span></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p039"><p>Like the Persians, the Greeks were an expansive people, but their expansion took the form of settlement in distant places rather than conquest and empire. Pushed by a growing population, Greek traders in search of iron and impoverished Greek farmers in search of land stimulated a remarkable emigration. Between 750 and 500 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, the Greeks established settlements all around the Mediterranean basin and the rim of the Black Sea. Settlers brought Greek culture, language, and building styles to these new lands, even as they fought, traded, and intermarried with their non-Greek neighbors.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p040"><p>The most distinctive feature of Greek civilization, and the greatest contrast with Persia, lay in the extent of popular participation in political life that occurred within at least some of the city-states. It was the idea of “citizenship,” of free people managing the affairs of state, of equality for all citizens before the law, that was so unique. A foreign king, observing the operation of the public assembly in Athens, was amazed that male citizens as a whole actually voted on matters of policy: “I find it astonishing,” he noted, “that here wise men speak on public affairs, while fools decide them.”<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec2-002_6">6</span> Compared to the rigid hierarchies, inequalities, and absolute monarchies of Persia and other ancient civilizations, the Athenian experiment was remarkable. This is how one modern scholar defined it:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext-ni" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p041"><p>Among the Greeks the question of who should reign arose in a new way. Previously the most that had been asked was whether one man or another should govern and whether one alone or several together. But now the question was whether all the citizens, including the poor, might govern and whether it would be possible for them to govern as citizens, without specializing in politics. In other words, should the governed themselves actively participate in politics on a regular basis?<span data-type="termref" data-term="fn_strayersources3ehs-ch03-sec2-002_7">7</span></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p042"><p>The extent of participation and the role of “citizens” varied considerably, both over time and from city to city. Early in Greek history, only wealthy and well-born men had the rights of full citizenship, such as speaking and voting in the assembly, holding public office, and fighting in the army. Gradually, men of the lower classes, mostly small-scale farmers, also obtained these rights. At least in part, this broadening of political rights was associated with the growing number of men able to afford the armor and weapons that would allow them to serve as hoplites, or infantrymen, in the armies of the city-states. In many places, strong but benevolent rulers known as tyrants emerged for a time, usually with the support of the poorer classes, to challenge the prerogatives of the wealthy. Sparta — famous for its extreme forms of military discipline and its large population of helots, conquered people who lived in slave-like conditions — vested most political authority in its Council of Elders. The council was composed of twenty-eight men over the age of sixty, derived from the wealthier and more influential segment of society, who served for life and provided political leadership for Sparta.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="strayersources3ehs_page_113"><p>113</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p043"><p>It was in Athens that the Greek experiment in political participation achieved its most distinctive expression. Early steps in this direction were the product of intense class conflict, leading almost to civil war. A reforming leader named Solon emerged in 594 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span> to push Athenian politics in a more democratic direction, breaking the hold of a small group of aristocratic families. Debt slavery was abolished, access to public office was opened to a wider group of men, and all citizens were allowed to take part in the Assembly. Later reformers such as Cleisthenes (KLEYE-sthuh-nees) and Pericles extended the rights of citizens even further. By 450 <span data-block_type="small">B.C.E.</span>, all holders of public office were chosen by lot and were paid, so that even the poorest could serve. The Assembly, where all citizens could participate, became the center of political life.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="strayersources3ehs-ch03-p044"><p>Athenian democracy, however, was different from modern democracy. It was direct, rather than representative, democracy, and it was distinctly limited. Women, slaves, and foreigners, together far more than half of the population, were wholly excluded from political participation. Nonetheless, political life in Athens was a world away from that of the Persian Empire and even from that of many other Greek cities.</p></div>
